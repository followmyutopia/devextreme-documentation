##### shortDescription
Configures the widget's title.

---
The widget's title is a short text that usually indicates what is visualized. If you need to specify the title's text only, assign it directly to the **title** option. Otherwise, set this option to an object with the **text** and other fields specified.

The title can be accompanied by a subtitle elaborating on the visualized subject using the **title**.[subtitle]({basewidgetpath}/Configuration/title/subtitle/) object.
