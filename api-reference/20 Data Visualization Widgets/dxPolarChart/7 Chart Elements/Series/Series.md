##### shortDescription
This section describes the **Series** object, which represents a series.

---
When you get a series as a function's return value, or a callback function parameter, you can use the members of the **Series** object.

To get the required series, use the chart's functions (e.g., [getAllSeries()](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxPolarChart/Methods/#getAllSeries), [getSeriesByName(seriesName)](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxPolarChart/Methods/#getSeriesByNameseriesName)).
