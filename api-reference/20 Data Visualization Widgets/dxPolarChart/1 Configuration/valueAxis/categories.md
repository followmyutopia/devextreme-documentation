##### shortDescription
Specifies the order in which discrete values are arranged on the value axis.

---
If you specify the chart's data using a common array of objects, these objects may be displayed in a random order. If you set the chart's data for each series individually, the order in which the series are positioned in the [series](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxPolarChart/Configuration/series/) array can also be random. In these instances, the resulting value order on the discrete value axis may not be appropriate. To specify the order of categories (values on a discrete value axis), assign an array of category names to the **categories** property.
