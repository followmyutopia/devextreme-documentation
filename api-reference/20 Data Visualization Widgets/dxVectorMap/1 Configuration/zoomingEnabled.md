##### shortDescription
Disables the [zooming](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/VectorMap/End-User_Interaction/#Zooming) capability.

---
Setting this option to **false** disables a user's ability to zoom the map. However, you can still zoom the map in code using the [zoomFactor(zoomFactor)](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxVectorMap/Methods/#zoomFactorzoomFactor) method.
