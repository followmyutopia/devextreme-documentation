##### shortDescription
Specifies range selector shutter options.

---
Shutters are used in the **RangeSelector** widget with the background ([image](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxRangeSelector/Configuration/background/image/) or [chart](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxRangeSelector/Configuration/chart/)) to hide the non-selected range. When using shutters, the background area for a selected range is clearly visible, and the remaining area is hidden by the shutters.
