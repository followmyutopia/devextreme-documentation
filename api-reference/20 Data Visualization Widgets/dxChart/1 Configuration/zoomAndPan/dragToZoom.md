##### shortDescription
Enables users to zoom the chart by selecting an area with the drag gesture. Applies only on devices that use a mouse.

---
When this option is set to **true**, the mouse's drag gesture is used for zooming instead of panning. To pan in this case, users should perform the drag gesture while pressing the [panKey](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/zoomAndPan/#panKey).
