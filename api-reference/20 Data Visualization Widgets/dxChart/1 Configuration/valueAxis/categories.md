##### shortDescription
Specifies the order of categories on an axis of the *"discrete"* [type](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxChart/1%20Configuration/valueAxis/type.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/valueAxis/#type').

---
By default, values on a discrete axis keep the order of objects in the data source. To change it, assign an array of properly sorted values to the **categories** option.

[note]Values missing from the **categories** array will be added to its end automatically.
