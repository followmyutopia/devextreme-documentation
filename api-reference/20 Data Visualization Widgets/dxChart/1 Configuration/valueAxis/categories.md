##### shortDescription
Specifies the order of categories on an axis of the *"discrete"* [type](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/valueAxis/#type).

---
By default, values on a discrete axis keep the order of objects in the data source. To change it, assign an array of properly sorted values to the **categories** option.

[note]Values missing from the **categories** array will be added to its end automatically.
