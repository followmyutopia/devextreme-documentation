Make sure that the [showFirstLast](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxSparkline/Configuration/#showFirstLast) option is set to **true**, so that this option takes effect.

To specify a color for the area inside of the point boundary, use the [pointColor](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxSparkline/Configuration/#pointColor) option.
