In this example, the point's **fullState** field is used to implement unselecting of a selected point. The function, which is assigned to the **onPointClick** option, checks the current state of the clicked point. If the point is selected, the selection will be removed using the **clearSelection()** method. Otherwise, the point will be selected using the point's **select()** method.
