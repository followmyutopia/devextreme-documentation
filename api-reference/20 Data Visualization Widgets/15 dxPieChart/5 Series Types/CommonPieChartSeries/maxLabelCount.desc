In this example, the chart has 7 points. Initially, the point labels are displayed as the label's **visible** option is set to **true** and the series' **maxLabelCount** value equals *7*. If you check the "6" radio button below the chart, the **maxLabelCount** option will be equal *6*, which is less than the number of points in the chart series. As a result, the point labels will not be displayed.
