To make your gauge "live", enable animation for it by setting the **enabled** option of the **animation** object to **true**. In this instance, the gauge bars will appear in motion. In addition, within the **animation** object you can set an appropriate easing mode using the **easing** option, and specify how long the animation should run using the **duration** option.
