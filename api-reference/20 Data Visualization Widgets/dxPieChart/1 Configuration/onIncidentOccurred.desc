Use the check box below to change the size of the chart container. When checking the check box, the chart container becomes too small to display the chart. As a result, the widget produces a warning. The function assigned to the **onIncidentOccurred** field is used to display the warning message under the widget. Uncheck the check box to restore the previous size of the chart container.
