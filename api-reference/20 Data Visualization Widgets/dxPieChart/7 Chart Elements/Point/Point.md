##### shortDescription
This section describes the **Point** object, which represents a series point.

---
When you get a point as the return value of a function, or a callback function parameter, you can use the members of the Point object.

To get the required point of a particular series, use series' functions (e.g., [getAllPoints()](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxPieChart/Chart_Elements/Series/Methods/#getAllPoints), [getPointsByArg(pointArg)](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxPieChart/Chart_Elements/Series/Methods/#getPointsByArgpointArg)).
