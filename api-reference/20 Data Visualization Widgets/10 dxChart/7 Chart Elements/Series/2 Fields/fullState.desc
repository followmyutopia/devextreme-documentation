In this example, the series' **fullState** field is used to implement deselecting of a selected series. The function, which is assigned to the **onSeriesClick** option, checks the current state of the clicked series. If the series is selected, the selection will be removed using the **clearSelection()** method. Otherwise, the series will be selected using the series' **select()** method.
