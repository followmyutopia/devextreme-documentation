In this example, use the buttons below to subscribe different handlers to the [pointHoverChanged](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Events/#pointHoverChanged) event. One of the handlers displays information on a hovered point at the bottom of the chart, whereas the other one displays it using the [Toast](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxToast/) widget. The **Unsubscribe** button calls the chart's **off("pointHoverChanged")** method, which clears the list of **pointHoverChanged** event subscribers.
