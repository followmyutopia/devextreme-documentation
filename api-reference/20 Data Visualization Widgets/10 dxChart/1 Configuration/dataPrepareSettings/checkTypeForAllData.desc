Toggle the check box below to switch between the values of the **checkTypeForAllData** option. Note that here the data source contains values of different types. When the **checkTypeForAllData** option is on, both the axes become discrete in order to display the specific values like *r* on the argument axis or *b* on the value axis. When the **checkTypeForAllData** option is off, the argument axis is continuous because the first argument in the data source is numeric, while the value axis is discrete because the first value in the data source is string. In this case, the { 'r', 10 } series point is ignored, because the argument cannot be cast to the numeric type to be displayed on the continuous argument axis.
