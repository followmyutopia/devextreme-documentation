##### shortDescription
Appears when the specified tick intervals lead **Chart** or **RangeSelector** to generating an excessive number of ticks.

---
When dividing the **Chart**'s [axes](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Chart/Axes/Overview/) or **RangeSelector**'s [scale](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/RangeSelector/Visual_Elements/#Scale), you can specify intervals for major and minor ticks. However, if these intervals appear too small, the widgets will ignore them and divide the axes or scale using default tick intervals. In addition, the W2003 warning will appear.
