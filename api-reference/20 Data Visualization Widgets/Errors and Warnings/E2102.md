##### shortDescription
Occurs in **Chart** when two or more value axes on a single pane have the same name.

---
When you visualize data using several value axes on a single [pane](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Chart/Panes/Overview/), these axes must have different [names](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/valueAxis/#name). If they do not, the E2102 occurs.
