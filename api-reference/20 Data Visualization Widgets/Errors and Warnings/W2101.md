##### shortDescription
Appears if the [pane](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Chart/Panes/Overview/) specified by the [defaultPane](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/#defaultPane) option does not exist.

---
When a multi-pane chart is used, you can specify the pane to be used by default using the **defaultPane** option. The name of the pane assigned to this option must be also declared within the [panes](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/panes/) array. Otherwise, the W2101 warning appears, and the last pane declared in this array is used.
