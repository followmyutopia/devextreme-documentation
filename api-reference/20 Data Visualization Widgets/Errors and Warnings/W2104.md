##### shortDescription
Appears when a chart hides its legend due to the layout being adapted.

---
This warning may appear if your scenario allows for the change of the widget container's size. If so, when the size is reduced down to a minimum, which is specified by the **height** and **width** options of the [adaptive layout](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/adaptiveLayout/) object, accessory widget elements will be hidden. The W2104 warning, particularly, appears when the chart hides its [legend](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Chart/Legend/Overview/).
