##### shortDescription
Appears if a value axis specified for a series does not exist.

---
Using a multi-axis chart), you should specify a value axis for each series using the **series**.[axis](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/series/#axis) option. These value axes should be declared in the [valueAxis](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/valueAxis/) array as well. If not, a value axis with the name specified for a series will be created automatically, and the widget will place the W2102 warning into the browser console.
