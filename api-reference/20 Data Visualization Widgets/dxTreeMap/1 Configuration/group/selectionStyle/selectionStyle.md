When the user selects a group, this element responds by changing its style. Using the fields of the **selectionStyle** object, you can specify the [color](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxTreeMap/Configuration/group/selectionStyle/#color) of group headers and appearance of [group borders](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxTreeMap/Configuration/group/selectionStyle/#border) in the selected state.

To learn how to implement the selection feature and get familiar with available selection modes, refer to the [selectionMode](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxTreeMap/Configuration/#selectionMode) option description.
