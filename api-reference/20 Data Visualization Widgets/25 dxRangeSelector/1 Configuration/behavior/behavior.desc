In this example, a number of options belonging to the **behavior** configuration object are changed. Particularly, the **snapToTicks** option is set to *'false'*, so the **RangeSelector**'s sliders do not dock to the scale ticks. These sliders cannot swap their places as the **allowSlidersSwap** option is also set to *'false'*. In addition, widget animation is disabled by setting the **animationEnabled** option to *'false'*.
