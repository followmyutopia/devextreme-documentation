Consider two horizontally aligned range selectors with the different height of the slider markers. Due to this difference, the chart displayed on the background of both range selectors is scaled differently. To avoid inconsistent data presentation caused by the slider marker, set the marker's **placeholderHeight** option to the same value. Use the checkbox at the bottom of range selectors to do it.
