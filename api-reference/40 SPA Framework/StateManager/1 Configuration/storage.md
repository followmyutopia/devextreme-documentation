A storage to which the state manager saves the application state. 
<!--/shortDescription-->

<!--fullDescription-->
As the StateManager object is created internally, you do not have to create it manually. However, you can specify the storage to be used by the application's state manager to store the application state. For this purpose, use the [stateStorage](/Documentation/ApiReference/SPA_Framework/HtmlApplication/Configuration/#stateStorage) configuration option of the [HtmlApplication](/Documentation/ApiReference/SPA_Framework/HtmlApplication/) object.
