<!--shortDescription-->
Occurs when more than one layout controller is appropriate in the current context.
<!--/shortDescription-->

<!--fullDescription-->
To choose the controller to be used in the current context, the objects added to the application's [layout set](/Documentation/ApiReference/SPA_Framework/HtmlApplication/Configuration/#layoutSet) are considered. These objects define which layout controllers should be used in different contexts. When several objects (registrations) suit the current context, this error occurs. To investigate the problem, use the information that is provided in the browser's console - you will see the current context and the list of competitive registrations. To have only one kind of registration in the current context, define it more specifically within the layout set or handle the application's [resolveLayoutController](/Documentation/ApiReference/SPA_Framework/HtmlApplication/Events/#resolveLayoutController) event.
