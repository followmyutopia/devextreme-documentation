<!--fullDescription-->
A view may have several HTML templates - each for a particular platform and type of the device. When navigating to a view, an HTML template appropriate for the current context is chosen. To avoid situations when several templates are appropriate, define contexts for views more specifically. For details, refer to the [Context Specific Markup](/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Views_and_Layouts/#Context_Specific_Markup) topic.
