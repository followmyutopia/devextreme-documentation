<!--shortDescription-->
Occurs when the application's [router](/Documentation/ApiReference/SPA_Framework/HtmlApplication/Fields/#router) cannot parse the URI to which the application navigates.
<!--/shortDescription-->

<!--fullDescription-->
You can see the URI to which the application navigates in the browser's address bar. Check whether the URI is correct. If yes, check to which [routing rules](/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Navigation_and_Routing/#Declare_a_Routing) this URL must conform. If it conforms to none of the rules, add/change the rules or change the URI.

[note]Run the application in a browser without the [DevExtreme Simulator](/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Simulation_Tools/#Use_Simulator) to see the current URI.
