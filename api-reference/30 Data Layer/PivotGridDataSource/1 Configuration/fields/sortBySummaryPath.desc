In this example, the *"Region"* items are sorted by the summary values of the *"Amount"* field. Pay attention to the *"Region"* field configuration. It has the **sortBySummaryField** and **sortBySummaryPath** options specified. You can change the value of the latter option at runtime using the select box below the pivot grid. It will sort the *"Region"* items by the summary values of another column.
