In this example, all fields are specified explicitly as the [retrieveFields](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/PivotGridDataSource/Configuration#retrieveFields) option is set to **false**. There are fields that define date constituents: *"Year"*, *"Quarter"* and *"Month"*. To be collected into one folder in the field chooser, these fields have an identical value of the **displayFolder** option. Click the icon in the upper-left grid corner to invoke the field chooser and note the folder.
