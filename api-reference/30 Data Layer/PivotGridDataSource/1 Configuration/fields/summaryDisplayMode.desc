In this example, the pivot grid contains two data fields with an identical **dataField** value. The *"Sales Total"* field displays the data field values and the *"Var"* field displays the result of post-processing those values. Right-click the *"Var"* field on the field panel and select an item from the appeared context menu to switch the post-processing algorithm (summary display mode).
