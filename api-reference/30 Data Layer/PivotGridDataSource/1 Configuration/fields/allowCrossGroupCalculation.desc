In this example, summary values are accumulated across each row as the [runningTotal](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/PivotGridDataSource/Configuration/fields#runningTotal) option is set to *"row"*. These values can be accumulated within each expanded group or across all groups. This characteristic is controlled by the value of the **allowCrossGroupCalculation** option. You can change it at runtime using the switch below the pivot grid.
