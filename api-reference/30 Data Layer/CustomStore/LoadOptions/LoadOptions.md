##### shortDescription
This section describes the **loadOptions** object's fields.

---
This object is used to specify settings according to which the server should process data. More often these settings are passed as a parameter to the [load](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/CustomStore/Configuration/#load) function and depend on the operations (paging, filtering, sorting, etc.) that you have enabled in the [DataSource](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/DataSource/) or widget.
