##### shortDescription
The IDs of the rows being expanded. Relevant only when the **CustomStore** is used in the [TreeList](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxTreeList/) widget.
---

If the **TreeList**'s [expandedRowKeys](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxTreeList/Configuration/#expandedRowKeys) are set, the **parentIds** array contains them and the root ID. Otherwise, the array contains only the ID of the row being expanded.
