##### shortDescription
Occurs if the count of first-level groups (**groupCount**) was not obtained when loading data.

---
This error is specific to the [CustomStore](/api-reference/30%20Data%20Layer/CustomStore '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/CustomStore/') Data Store.

This error occurs if the [load](/api-reference/30%20Data%20Layer/CustomStore/1%20Configuration/load.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/CustomStore/Configuration/#load') method has resolved the Promise with an unspecified or empty **groupCount**.

You can solve the problem by implementing the load method in the following manner.

    <!--JavaScript-->
    var store = new DevExpress.data.CustomStore({
        // . . .
        load: function (loadOptions) {
            var deferred = $.Deferred();
            $.get('url/to/the/resource', loadOptions)
                .done(function (response) {
                    deferred.resolve({ data: response.data, groupCount: response.groupCount });
                });
            return deferred.promise();
        }
    });
