##### shortDescription
Occurs in [DataGrid](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/) if the browser does not support local storage or session storage.

Use custom implementation of state storing. In this case, you should set the [stateStoring.type](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/stateStoring/#type) option to "custom" and pass the appropriate functions to the [stateStoring.cusomLoad](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/stateStoring/#customLoad) and [stateStoring.customSave](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/stateStoring/#customSave) options.
