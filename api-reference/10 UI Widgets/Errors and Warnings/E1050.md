##### shortDescription
Occurs in the **DataGrid** or **TreeList** when trying to check the [validationRules](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/columns/#validationRules) of a column that has a third-party editor in its [editCellTemplate](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/columns/#editCellTemplate).

---
This error is specific to the popup and form [editing modes](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/editing/#mode). To correct it, choose a different editing mode or validate the editor's value in the [onRowValidating](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#onRowValidating) function instead of using the validation rules.
