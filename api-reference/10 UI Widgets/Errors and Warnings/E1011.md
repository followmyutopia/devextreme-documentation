##### shortDescription
Occurs if an item of the [List](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxList/) widget is deleted, while the [remove(key)](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/CustomStore/Methods/#removekey) method of the [CustomStore](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/CustomStore/) used to access data is not implemented.

---
Pass the function implementing the **remove(key)** method to the [remove](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/CustomStore/Configuration/#remove) option of the **CustomStore**.
