##### shortDescription
This article describes configuration options of a simple form item.

---
A simple form item is an editor-label pair usually bound to a [formData](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxForm/Configuration/#formData) object field used to display and modify this field.

You can also create a simple item without binding it to a **formData** field. For example, it can be a check box that allows a user to confirm his agreement to process entered data.

For detailed information on configuring simple items, see the [Configure Simple Items](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Form/Configure_Simple_Items/) topic.
