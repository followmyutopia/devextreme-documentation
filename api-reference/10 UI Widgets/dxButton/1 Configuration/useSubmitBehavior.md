##### shortDescription
Specifies whether or not the button must submit an HTML form.

If you set this option to **true**, a click on the button will validate and submit the HTML form in which the button is nested, no further configuration required. Note that the [click](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxButton/4%20Events/click.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxButton/Events/#click') event handler will be executed first.
