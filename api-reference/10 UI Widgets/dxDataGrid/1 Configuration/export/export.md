##### shortDescription
Configures client-side exporting.

---
When client-side exporting is [enabled](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/export/#enabled), the grid toolbar contains the Export button ( <img src="/Content/images/doc/19_2/DataGrid/icons/toolbar_export.png" alt="DevExtreme DataGrid HTML5 Toolbar Exporting" style="vertical-align:middle"/> ) that exports grid data to Excel. For details on exporting, refer to the [Client-Side Exporting](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Client-Side_Exporting/) article.

[note]Client-side exporting requires the JSZip library. Learn where you can get it from topics in the [Installation](/Documentation/Guide/Getting_Started/Installation/Local_Scripts/) section.
