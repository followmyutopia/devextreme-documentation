##### shortDescription
Specifies the scrolling mode.

---
The following scrolling modes are available in the widget:

- **Standard**      
A user scrolls a single page only. Scrolling appears only if [all the page's rows](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/GridBase/1%20Configuration/paging/pageSize.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/paging/#pageSize') do not fit into the widget's height. In this mode, the [pager](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/GridBase/1%20Configuration/pager '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/pager/') performs the main navigation and scrolling is auxiliary. If [paging](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/GridBase/1%20Configuration/paging '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/paging/') is disabled, the widget loads all rows at once, which may decrease the widget's performance. In this case, we recommend choosing another scrolling mode.

- **Virtual**       
This mode is an alternative to paging where pages are loaded when they get into the viewport and removed once they leave it. Use this mode if a user should be able to scroll data by pages.

    [note] While scrolling in **virtual** mode, gray boxes can appear when the widget renders data. This happens when the data is being loaded from a remote data source or when a local data source has a heavy structure, for example, it has templates, too many columns for your device, etc. This is normal behavior.    
    Refer to the [Rendering Optimization](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Enhance_Performance_on_Large_Datasets/#Rendering_Optimization) article to learn how to optimize data rendering.

- **Infinite**      
This mode is an alternative to paging where each next page is loaded once the scrollbar reaches the end of its scale. Use this mode if a user should scroll data gradually, from the first to the last page.

    [note] Set the **grouping**.[allowCollapsing](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid/1%20Configuration/grouping/allowCollapsing.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/grouping/#allowCollapsing') option to **false** when using infinite scrolling in conjunction with grouping.
