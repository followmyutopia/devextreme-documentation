##### shortDescription
Configures editing.

---
The widget can allow a user to add, update and delete data. To control which of these operations are allowed, use the [allowAdding]({basewidgetpath}/Configuration/editing/#allowAdding), [allowUpdating]({basewidgetpath}/Configuration/editing/#allowUpdating) and [allowDeleting]({basewidgetpath}/Configuration/editing/#allowDeleting) options. Editing can be carried out in different modes, which are detailed in the [mode]({basewidgetpath}/Configuration/editing/#mode) option's description.

[note] Before allowing a user to add, update, and delete, make sure that your [data source]({basewidgetpath}/Configuration/#dataSource) supports these actions.
