In this example, grid settings allow you to delete rows. Since batch edit mode is set, you can also recover deleted rows. Note that when you save changes, rows that have the *format* field equaling *"hardcover"* will not be deleted from the data source and will stay recoverable. It is the result of implementing the **onRowRemoving** function that prohibits these rows from being deleted.
