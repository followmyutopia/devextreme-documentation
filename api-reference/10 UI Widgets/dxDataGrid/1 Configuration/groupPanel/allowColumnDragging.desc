In this example, you can block the group panel to prevent grid columns from being dragged onto it. The column dragging capability is controlled by the **groupPanel** | **allowColumnDragging** option. When this option equals *true*, grid columns can be dragged onto and from the group panel; when *false*, they cannot. You can change the value of the aforementioned option at runtime using the check box under the grid.
