In this example, grid records are initially grouped by the *Format* column. In addition, the group panel is made visible using the **groupPanel** | **visible** option. However, the capability to drag columns onto and from the group panel is disabled by setting the **groupPanel** | **allowColumnDragging** option to *false*. Thus, a user can only see how grid records are grouped, but cannot change the initial grouping.
