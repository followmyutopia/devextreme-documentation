In this example, you can change the value of the **columnAutoWidth** option using the check box below. Note that when this option is **true**, each grid column has a width that is optimal for displaying the content of this column in full. However, with this setting applied, horizontal scrolling appears as well. When the aforementioned option is **false**, grid columns have an even width.
