In this example, the **orders** data array is presented in a grid. Display values of the *"Employee"* column are calculated using the function specified for a column's **calculateDisplayValue** option. In this function, the **employees** data array is scanned until an *Employee* object with the ID equal to the current order's *EmployeeID* field value is found. The value returned by this function is a concatenation of the *"TitleOfCourtesy"* and *"LastName"* field values of the found *Employee* object.
