In this example, the *"Format"* is declared as a lookup column. To filter grid records by this column, use the select box appearing in this column's filter row cell. Additionally, you can edit grid records. Note that when you edit values in the *"Format"* column, a select box similar to the filtering one does not let you enter any values other than those represented in the select box.
