In this example, you can filter grid records by values from different columns using the filter row. Note that filtering is enabled for all columns by making the filter row visible, but for the *"Customer ID"* column it is disabled explicitly by setting the **allowFiltering** option of this column to *false*. Try to type several symbols in a filter row cell or the search panel, and grid records will be filtered by them.
