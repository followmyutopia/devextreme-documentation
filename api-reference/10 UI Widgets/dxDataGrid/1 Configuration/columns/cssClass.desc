In this example, a grid contains five columns each of which has an applied CSS style. The styles are applied using the **cssClass** option. You can change the CSS style of a column at runtime with controls located below the grid. Choose a required column using radio buttons and a CSS style using a drop-down menu. To apply the style to the column, click the *"Apply Style"* button. To remove a style, click the *"Remove Style"* button.
