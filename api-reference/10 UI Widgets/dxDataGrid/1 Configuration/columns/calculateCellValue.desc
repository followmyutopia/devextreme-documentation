In this example, the **orders** data array is presented in a grid. The *"Employee"* column is populated with the values that are calculated using the function specified for the column's **calculateCellValue** option. In this function, the **employees** data array is scanned until an *Employee* object with the ID equal to the current order's *EmployeeID* field value is found. The value returned by this function is a concatenation of the *"TitleOfCourtesy"*, *"FirstName"* and *"LastName"* field values of the found *Employee* object.
