In this example, the visible group panel enables you to group records. Note that for the *"Format"* column, the **autoExpandGroup** option is set to *false*. Thus, when you group records by this column, the corresponding groups appear collapsed. As for other columns, this option preserves its default value - *true*. Thus, when you group records by these columns, the groups appear expanded.
