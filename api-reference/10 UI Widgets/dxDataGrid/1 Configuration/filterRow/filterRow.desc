In this example, the filter row is made visible by setting the **filterRow**.**visible** option to **true**. In addition, a filter operation is selected for each grid column from code using the **selectedFilterOperation** option. This operation can not be changed at runtime, because the **filterRow**.**showOperationChooser** option is set to **false**.
