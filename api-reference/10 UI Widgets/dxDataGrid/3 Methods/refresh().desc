This example illustrates the use of the grid's **refresh()** method. Here, you can change the array specified as a data source to the grid without using the grid's API. A click on the *"Delete a Random Record"* button deletes a record straight from this array. The grid, however, does not mirror these changes yet. To force it, click the *"Refresh"* button, which calls the grid's **refresh()** method.
