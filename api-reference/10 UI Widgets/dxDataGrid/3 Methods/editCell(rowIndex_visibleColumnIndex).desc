This example shows how to use the **DataGrid** **editCell(rowIndex, visibleColumnIndex)** and [closeEditCell()](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Methods#closeEditCell) methods. Use the number boxes located under the grid to choose row and column indexes specifying the cell that must be switched into the editing state. After that, click the *"Edit Cell"* button, which calls the **editCell(rowIndex, visibleColumnIndex)** method. The specified cell will enter the editing state. To draw this cell back to the normal state, click the *"Close Cell"* button, which calls the **closeEditCell()** method.
