This example illustrates the capability to direct the editing process in the **DataGrid** widget from code. First, select the index of the row that must be switched into the editing state. Then, click the *"Edit the Row"* button located under the grid. A click on this button calls the **editRow(rowIndex)** method with the selected index passed as the argument. After the record is edited, save or discard changes by clicking the *"Save the Row"* or *"Cancel"* button.
