In this example, grid rows can be deleted in the *batch* [edit mode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/editing#mode). To delete a row, select its index in the number box and then click the *"Delete Row"* button located under the grid. This button calls the **removeRow(rowIndex)** method. Deleted rows can be restored. For this purpose, select the index of the row, which must be restored, in the number box and click the *"Undelete Row"* button located under the grid. This button calls the **undeleteRow(rowIndex)** method. Additionally, you can save or discard the executed changes using the *"Save Changes"* or *"Cancel Changes"* button. These buttons call the **saveEditData()** or **cancelEditData()** method respectively.
