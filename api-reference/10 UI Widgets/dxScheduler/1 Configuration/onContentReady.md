If data displayed by the widget is specified using a [DataSource](/api-reference/30%20Data%20Layer/DataSource/DataSource.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/DataSource/') instance, the **contentReady** event fires each time the [load()](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/DataSource/Methods/#load) method of the DataSource instance is called, as well as when the widget content is ready or an appointment is modified.
