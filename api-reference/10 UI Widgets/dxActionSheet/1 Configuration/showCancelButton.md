type: Boolean
default: true

##### shortDescription
Specifies whether or not to display the **Cancel** button in action sheet.

---
The **Cancel** button closes the action sheet.

[note]The **showCancelButton** option makes sense only if the [usePopover](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxActionSheet/Configuration/#usePopover) option is disabled. Otherwise, the **Cancel** button is hidden. In this case, the popover is closed by an outside click.
