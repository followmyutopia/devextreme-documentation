##### shortDescription
An array of items displayed by the widget.

You can use the [dataSource]({basewidgetpath}/Configuration/#dataSource) option instead. Unlike the **items** option, the **dataSource** option can take on the [DataSource](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/DataSource/) configuration object as well as a simple array.
