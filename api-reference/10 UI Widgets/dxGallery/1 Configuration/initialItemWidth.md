##### shortDescription
Specifies the width of an area used to display a single image.

If this option is defined, the gallery displays as many horizontally arranged images scaled down to **initialItemWidth** as it can display without cropping them.

If the [stretchImages]({basewidgetpath}/Configuration/#stretchImages) option is set to **true**, the image sizes can be enlarged to fit the gallery width.
