##### shortDescription
Specifies if the widget stretches images to fit the total gallery width.

---
If this option is set to **true**, the widget enlarges images to fit the total gallery width. Otherwise, the widget adds an appropriate margin between images to evenly distribute them along the gallery width.

[note]An image element can be enlarged only up to the image's actual size. If the element's size reaches the image's actual size, the widget adds appropriate margins at the sides of the image element.
