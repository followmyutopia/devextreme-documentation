##### shortDescription
The node's key.

Keys are provided by the [key](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/CustomStore/Configuration/#key) field of the store that underlies the [dataSource](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxTreeList/Configuration/#dataSource). Alternatively, you can set the widget's [keyExpr](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxTreeList/Configuration/#keyExpr) option. With hierarchical data, keys can be generated automatically if **key** and **keyExpr** are not set.
