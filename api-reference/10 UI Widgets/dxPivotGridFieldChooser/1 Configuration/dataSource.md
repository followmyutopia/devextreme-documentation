##### shortDescription
The data source of a [PivotGrid](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxPivotGrid/dxPivotGrid.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxPivotGrid/') widget.

---
It is important for the data source of the **PivotGridFieldChooser** to be the same as the data source of its **PivotGrid** widget. This will allow the field chooser to manage data in the pivot grid. Use the PivotGrid's [getDataSource](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxPivotGrid/Methods/#getDataSource) method to acquire its data source.
