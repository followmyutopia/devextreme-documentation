##### shortDescription
Configures state storing.

---
State storing enables the widget to save applied settings and restore them the next time the widget is loaded. These settings include filtering, sorting, column order and width, selection, grouping (except the state of each group: expanded or collapsed), and others. Assign **true** to the **stateStoring**.[enabled](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/GridBase/1%20Configuration/stateStoring/enabled.md '{basewidgetpath}/Configuration/stateStoring/#enabled') option to enable this functionality.
