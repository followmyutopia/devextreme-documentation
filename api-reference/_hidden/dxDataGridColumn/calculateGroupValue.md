By default, [grouping](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Grouping/) is conducted using the exact values that the grouping column contains. However, in some cases, this approach may be giving poor results, e.g., when a user tries to group records by a column that contains dates. In such cases, it may be preferable to use calculated values in grouping. For this purpose, assign a function to the **calculateGroupValue** option. This function must return the calculated value for grouping.
