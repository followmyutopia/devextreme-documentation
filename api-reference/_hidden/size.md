##### shortDescription
The diameter of the legend item's marker in pixels.

If the legend is [grouped by size](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxVectorMap/Configuration/legends/source/#grouping), this option's value is different for each legend item. Otherwise, the value equals the [markerSize](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxVectorMap/Configuration/legends/#markerSize).
