Once the required libraries are referenced, you are ready to create the **Form** widget on your page.

To add a form widget, add a **div** element with the **id** attribute set to "formContainer" to the body of the HTML document as shown in the HTML file below. To associate the [Form](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxForm/) widget with the created element, call the **Form** constructor once the document has been loaded and pass the appropriate configuration object to this constructor (*form.js*).

The next step is to provide data for the **Form** widget.
