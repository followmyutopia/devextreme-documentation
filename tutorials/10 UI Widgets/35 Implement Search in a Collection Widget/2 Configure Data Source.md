In this step, specify the [searchExpr](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/DataSource/Configuration/#searchExpr) option as shown in the *script.js* file below. This option defines the value by which items are searched. To search items by the **name** field value, assign 'name' to this option.

[note]If you specify some DataSource options in addition to the accessed array, the array should be assigned to the [store](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/DataSource/Configuration/store/) option of the **DataSource** configuration object.

For more information on **DataSource** search capabilities, refer to the [Data Layer](/Documentation/Guide/Data_Layer/Data_Layer/#Reading_Data/Search_Api) article.
