All DevExtreme widgets are added to the application in the same manner. You will add a **Button** widget to understand the common principles of adding widgets.

To add a button widget, add a **div** element with the **id** attribute set to "buttonContainer" to the body of the HTML document as shown in the HTML file below. To associate the [Button](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxButton/) widget with the created element, call the **Button** constructor once the document has been loaded and pass the appropriate configuration object to this constructor.

For now, the configuration object contains only the [text](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxButton/Configuration/#text) option, which specifies the button text.
