To simplify this tutorial and place emphases on how to transport received data to a grid, a custom service will not be implemented. Instead, JSON data will be requested from a file located remotely.

[Here](/Content/Applications/16_2/Framework/UseRemoteDataforDataGrid/Step2/weatherData.js), you can see the JSON data that will be loaded to the grid from a remote source. When reproducing this tutorial, you can copy this data and paste it to a file in your project.
