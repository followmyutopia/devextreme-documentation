Use an SlideOut AngularJS Application project template to create a DevExtreme application. You can find this application template in the **Application Templates** | **AngularJS** | **SlideOut** folder of the [DevExtreme Mobile](/Documentation/Guide/Common/DevExtreme_Packages/#DevExtreme_Mobile) zip archive.

Run the application in a browser. Use any web server (Apache HTTP Server, IIS or any other). As you can see, the application has two views accessible from the slide-out menu that serves as the application's global navigation control.

Return to the application code. Investigate it to be aware of how the application is built. Read the [Application Templates](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Widgets/Basics/Application_Templates/#Application_Templates) | [AngularJS Approach](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Widgets/Basics/Application_Templates/#Mobile_Application/Angular_Approach) topic where this application template is described.
