DevExtreme comes with several [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)-based application templates utilizing [DevExtreme UI widgets](/Documentation/Guide/Common/Introduction_to_DevExtreme/#Mobile_Development/Overview/UI_Widgets_Library). These templates allow you to start developing a mobile single-page application quickly. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the AngularJS SlideOut Application template. In this template, the [SlideOut](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxSlideOut/) widget is used as a global navigation control. You will modify this template and get an application that allows end users to see a schedule for each week day.
