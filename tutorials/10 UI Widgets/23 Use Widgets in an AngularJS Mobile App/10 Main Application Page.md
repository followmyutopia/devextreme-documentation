The main application page (implemented in the *index.html* file) - contains the [SlideOut](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxSlideOut/) widget. This widget serves as a global navigation control in the application. Items in the slide-out menu provide access to the root application views. When clicking a menu item, a corresponding view is displayed. In this application template, the "home" and "about" views are displayed from the slide-out menu.

The only thing that you should do in the application page code is to change the application's title to "Week Schedule".

    <!--HTML--><head>
        <title>Week Schedule</title>
    </head>
