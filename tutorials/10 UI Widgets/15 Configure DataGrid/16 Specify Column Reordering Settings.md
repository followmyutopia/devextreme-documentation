You can allow an end-user to reorder grid columns by setting the [allowColumnReordering](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#allowColumnReordering) option to *true*. If you do it, the user can drag-and-drop columns to reorder them. However, certain columns can be restricted from being reordered. Set the [allowReordering](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/columns/#allowReordering) option for those columns to *false*, if such a restriction is required.

In your grid, allow column reordering for the grid and move to the next step where you will learn to configure sorting in the **DataGrid** widget.
