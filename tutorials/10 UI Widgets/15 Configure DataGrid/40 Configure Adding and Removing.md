To specify whether or not records can be added to and removed from a grid, set the **allowAdding** and **allowDeleting** options of the [editing](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/editing/) configuration object. In order to add a record, a user should click the *"Add New Item"* button located in the upper-right-corner of the grid layout. The added record appears empty as the first record of the grid indicating to enter data into its cells.

To remove a record, the user should click the *"Delete"* button that accompanies this record. In the batch [edit mode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/editing/#mode), the removed record can be recovered by clicking the *"Undelete"* button appearing in place of the *"Delete"* button.

To enable a user to add and remove grid records in the grid being implemented, set the **allowAdding** and **allowDeleting** options of the **editing** object. After that, move to the next step, where you will discover how to configure filtering and searching in the **DataGrid** widget.
