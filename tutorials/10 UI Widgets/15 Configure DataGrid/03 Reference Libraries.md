First, reference files required by the **DataGrid** on your HTML page. Note that jQuery and DevExtreme libraries are essential.

In addition to these scripts, **DataGrid** requires at least two stylesheet files. These mandatory files are the "dx.common.css", which provides the core styles and a theme-file that provides the distinctive look for **DataGrid**. Refer to the topics in the [Installation](/Documentation/Guide/Getting_Started/Installation/Local_Scripts/) section, to learn where you can get the libraries and stylesheets.
