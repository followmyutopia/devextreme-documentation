Begin by referencing files required by the **PivotGrid** on your HTML page. Add these files as scripts or links to the head of the page as it is done in the HTML file below. Note that jQuery and DevExtreme libraries are essential.

In addition to these scripts, dxPivorGrid requires two stylesheet files. The "dx.common.css" stylesheet provides the core styles. This stylesheet is required regardless of the target platform and theme. The second stylesheet is a theme-file that provides the distinctive look of the widget. Refer to the topics in the [Installation](/Documentation/Guide/Getting_Started/Installation/Local_Scripts/) section, to learn where you can get the libraries and stylesheets.
