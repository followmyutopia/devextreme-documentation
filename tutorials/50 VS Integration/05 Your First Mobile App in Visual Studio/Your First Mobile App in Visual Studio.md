This tutorial will walk you through creating your first DevExtreme application in Visual Studio. It will be a basic HTML JS single-page application built using the [DevExtreme SPA Framework](/Documentation/Guide/Common/Introduction_to_DevExtreme/#Mobile_Development/Overview/SPA_Framework) and [DevExtreme UI widgets](/Documentation/Guide/Common/Introduction_to_DevExtreme/#Mobile_Development/Overview/UI_Widgets_Library). Along the way, you will define two views by creating HTML templates and ViewModels. In addition, you will implement navigation between these views.
