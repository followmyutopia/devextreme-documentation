The **DevExtreme XX.X AngularJS SlideOut Application** template provides several features that are common for all DevExtreme project templates. To learn about these features, refer to the [DevExtreme App Project Template](/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Project_Templates/#DevExtreme_App_Project_Template) topic.

Run the application in any browser to test the application template. The application will be shown by the [simulator](/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Simulation_Tools/#Use_Simulator) - one of the tools included with the DevExtreme VS extension. The simulator allows you to view an application on different devices using the required landscape and scale.
