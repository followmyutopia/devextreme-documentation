This tutorial describes how to load data stored in an in-memory array using a DataSource instance. This lesson will show you how to create a DataSource instance and associate the required array with it, and how to process asynchronously loaded data. As a result, you will get a table displaying items of the loaded array.

[note] This tutorial only demonstrates the loading of data using a DataSource, without modifying this data. That is why the loaded array will equal the initial one.
