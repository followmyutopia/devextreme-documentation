To make this tutorial as simple as possible and accentuate the principal points of delivering remote data to a chart, a custom service will not be implemented. Instead, JSON data will be requested from a file located remotely.

[Here](/Content/Applications/16_2/DataVisualization/UseRemoteDataforChart/Step2/Content/data/weatherData.js), you can see JSON data that will be loaded to the chart from a remote source. When reproducing this tutorial, you can copy this data and paste it to a file in your project.
