The last thing to do for this chart is to display a title and relocate the legend to the bottom.

To specify a title, use the chart's [title](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/title/) option. This option accepts an object or a string. Pass a string if you need to set the title's text only. If you need to change the font or location of the title, pass an object.

To relocate the legend from its default place, use the [legend](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/legend/) configuration object. In this app, the legend is located at the bottom of the chart using the [horizontalAlignment](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/legend/#horizontalAlignment) and [verticalAlignment](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/legend/#verticalAlignment) options.

**Chart** is configured now. Finally, take a look at the **PieChart** widget, which is very similar in configuration.
