First, reference libraries required by **Chart** on your HTML page. Add them as scripts or links to the head of the page as shown in the HTML file below. Both **Chart** and **PieChart** require the *dx.viz.js* library. You can find this and other libraries in your [DevExtreme package](/Documentation/Guide/Common/DevExtreme_Packages/). For more information on linking libraries, refer to the [Installation](/Documentation/Guide/Data_Visualization/Basics/Installation/) topic.

Once the required libraries are linked, you are ready to create the **Chart** widget on your page. Like any other widget from the DevExtreme library, **Chart** must be held within a container element, for example, a `<div>`. Add this element to the `<body>` tag of your HTML document as shown in the code below.

Then, add a *.js* file to your project and reference it in the head of your HTML file just like you did for the libraries earlier. Create the **Chart** widget within the added div container as shown in the *chart.js* file.

Run this code and you will see an empty **Chart** widget for which data must now be provided.
