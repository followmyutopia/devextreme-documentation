Now, change the series type to [FullStackedArea](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Chart/Series_Types/#Full-Stacked_Area). If you want to compare point values and their aggregate for the same arguments, this series type will suit your needs perfectly.

Generally, you can specify a type for each series individually using its [type](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/series/#type) option. But for this app, use the **type** option of the [commonSeriesSettings](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/commonSeriesSettings/) configuration object to specify the *'fullStackedArea'* series type for all series at once.

Note that if you place the **Chart** widget on a page that uses a path modifier, you need to set the [pathModified](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/#pathModified) option to *true*. As an example of such modifiers, the [base](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_base.asp) HTML tag can be considered. Also, we recommend you enable this option if you place the widget inside the [`<iframe>`](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_iframe.asp) tag. This statement is correct for all widgets from the DevExtreme Data Visualization library. As our site uses the `<iframe>` tag to present the resulting widget, the **pathModified** option is specified in this demo.

To direct the viewer's focus at data, add point labels to the series. Proceed to the next step to learn how to do that.
