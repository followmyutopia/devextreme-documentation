Once the required libraries are referenced, you are ready to create the **TreeMap** widget on your page. Much like any other DevExtreme widget, **TreeMap** must be held within a container element, for example, a `<div>`. Add this element to the `<body>` tag of your HTML document as shown in the code below.

Then, add a *.js* file to your project and reference it in the head of your HTML file just like you did for the libraries earlier. Create the **TreeMap** widget within the added div container as shown in the *treemap.js* file.

The next step is to provide data for the **TreeMap** widget.
