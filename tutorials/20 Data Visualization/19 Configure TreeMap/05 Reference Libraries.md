First, you need to reference files required by **TreeMap** on your HTML page. Add these files as scripts to the head of your page as shown in the HTML file below. There are three DevExtreme bundles that contain the **TreeMap** widget: *dx.viz.js*, *dx.viz-web.js* and *dx.all.js*. This tutorial uses *dx.viz.js* as the most light-weight one of them. Refer to the topics in the [Installation](/Documentation/Guide/Getting_Started/Installation/Local_Scripts/) section, to learn where you can get these bundles.
