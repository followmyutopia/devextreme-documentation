  This step will guide you through adding interactive features to map areas and markers. Implement a function that will select/deselect a layer element by a click, and assign it to the [onClick](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxVectorMap/Configuration/#onClick) option. To allow the user to select multiple areas, change the selection mode of the *area* layer to *'multiple'* using the [selectionMode](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxVectorMap/Configuration/layers/#selectionMode) option. Note that the selection mode of the *marker* layer keeps the default setting - *'single'*. Hence, only one marker can be selected at a time.

  With the most complicated steps now completed, the next step is configuring the control bar.
