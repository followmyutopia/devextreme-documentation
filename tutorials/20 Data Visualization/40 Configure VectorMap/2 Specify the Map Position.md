To configure your map, you will need to utilize positioning adjustments, e.g., zooming or centering on some point of the map. These actions can be performed using the **bounds**, **center** and **zoomFactor** options.

This example uses the [bounds](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxVectorMap/Configuration/#bounds) option to focus the map on the United States. To zoom the map, use the [zoomFactor](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxVectorMap/Configuration/#zoomFactor) option, so that the marker labels are displayed nicely.

The next step is to customize the appearance of the map areas and markers.
