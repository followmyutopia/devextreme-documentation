To make the **RangeSelector** widget interact with other elements on the page, handle the [selectedRangeChanged](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxRangeSelector/Events/#selectedRangeChanged) event. For this purpose, assign a function to the [onSelectedRangeChanged](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxRangeSelector/Configuration/#onSelectedRangeChanged) option. Here, this function outputs the information about the selected range below the widget. The function's parameter provides access to the selected range. 

**RangeSelector** fires several more events that can be handled. You can view a full list of them in the [Events](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxRangeSelector/Events/) reference section. Although this tutorial shows how to handle only one of them, the others can be handled in the same manner.
