First, reference files required by the **RangeSelector** widget on your HTML page. Add these files as scripts to the head of the page as it is done in the HTML file below. Refer to the topics in the [Installation](/Documentation/Guide/Getting_Started/Installation/Local_Scripts/) section, to learn where you can get these and other libraries.

Once the required libraries are referenced, you are ready to create the **RangeSelector** widget on your page. Like any other widget from the DevExtreme library, **RangeSelector** must be held within a container element, for example, a `<div>`. Add this element to the `<body>` tag of your HTML document as shown in the code below.

Then, add a *.js* file to your project and reference it in the head of your HTML file just like you did for the libraries earlier. Create the **RangeSelector** widget within the added div container as shown in the *rangeSelector.js* file. Reference this JavaScript file in the head of your HTML file.

If you run the code now, you will see an empty **RangeSelector** widget. The next step will go over configuring its scale.
