To implement the current task, change the color of the value indicator and reduce the diameter of the spindle gap. You can change the appearance of the value indicator using the [valueIndicator](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxCircularGauge/Configuration/valueIndicator/) configuration object as shown in the code below.
  
The last thing to change in the **CircularGauge**'s appearance is the color of the subvalue indicator. To specify it, use the **color** option of the [subvalueIndicator](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxCircularGauge/Configuration/subvalueIndicator/) configuration object.

Note that **CircularGauge** provides indicators of different types. For a comprehensive overview of all of them, see the [Indicator Types](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxCircularGauge/Indicator_Types/) part of the gauge's Reference section.
