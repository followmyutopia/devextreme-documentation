According to the declared task, the value indicator must show the temperature in the selected city and the subvalue indicator must show the temperature of the current city. But before indicating values, you need to specify a scale for them. To do this, use the [scale](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxCircularGauge/Configuration/scale/) object. Declare the **startValue** and **endValue** fields within this object to set the scale boundaries. To indicate warm and cold temperatures with colors, use options of the [rangeContainer](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxCircularGauge/Configuration/rangeContainer/) object. The scale and the range container will get further adjustments in the following steps of this tutorial.

For training purposes, assign random values to the gauge indicators. Use the [value](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxCircularGauge/Configuration/#value) and [subvalues](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxCircularGauge/Configuration/#subvalues) options for this.
