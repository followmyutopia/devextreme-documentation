First, reference files required by the **CircularGauge** widget on your HTML page. Add these files as scripts to the head of the page as it is done in the HTML file below. You can find the libraries in your [DevExtreme package](/Documentation/Guide/Common/DevExtreme_Packages/). For more information on linking libraries, refer to the [Installation](/Documentation/Guide/Data_Visualization/Basics/Installation/) topic.

Once the required libraries are referenced, you are ready to create the **CircularGauge** widget on your page. Like any other widget from the DevExtreme library, **CircularGauge** must be held within a container element, for example, a `<div>`. Add this element to the `<body>` tag of your HTML document as shown in the code below.

Then, add a *.js* file to your project and reference it in the head of your HTML file just like you did for the libraries earlier. Create the **CircularGauge** widget within the added div container as shown in the *circularGauge.js* file.

Run this code and you will see the gauge with the default settings. It does not look much like a thermometer yet because it still needs to be customized. To begin, provide data for the gauge.
