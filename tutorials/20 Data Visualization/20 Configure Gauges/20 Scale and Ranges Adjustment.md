The scale consists of major and minor ticks, as well as labels. As you can see from the previous step's result, you can leave the labels as they are. However, you should make minor ticks visible and change the appearance of major ticks. To configure minor ticks, use the **scale** | [minorTick](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxCircularGauge/Configuration/scale/minorTick/) object. The **visible** option of this object controls the visibility of minor ticks. Major ticks are configured using the **scale** | [tick](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxCircularGauge/Configuration/scale/tick/) object. Additionally, the code below colors all ticks into black and sets their intervals.

Now, the scale ticks are almost indiscernible due to the range container occupying the background. To shift it towards the gauge's center, use the [offset](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxCircularGauge/Configuration/rangeContainer/#offset) option of the **rangeContainer** object. By default, this option equals 0. In the code below, the range container's offset is 5 pixels.

The next step will show you how to customize the appearance of the value and subvalue indicators.
