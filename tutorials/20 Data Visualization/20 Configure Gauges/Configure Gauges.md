This guide contains detailed instructions on how to configure the **CircularGauge**, **LinearGauge** and **BarGauge** widgets. You will learn how to provide data to be visualized on a gauge and customize its appearance per your requirements. As a result, you will get the **CircularGauge** and **LinearGauge** that display the local temperature and the temperature in the selected city, and the **BarGauge** that shows the temperature in several cities at once. These gauges will display the temperature in Celsius.
