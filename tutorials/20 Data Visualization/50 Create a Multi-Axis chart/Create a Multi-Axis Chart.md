This tutorial provides detailed instructions on how to configure the [Chart](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/) widget that displays several data series on one pane, but uses different value axes. Following the steps of this tutorial, you will learn to bind data series to value axes. As a result, you will get the **Chart** widget with two value axes - an absolute and a percentage one - each of which will be associated with one or multiple series.
