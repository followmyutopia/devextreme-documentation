In this final step, make several changes in the appearance of the value axes. Relocate the absolute value axis to the right side of the chart using the [position](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/valueAxis/#position) option. Then, change the format of the axis labels to *'largeNumber'* using the [label](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/valueAxis/label/) | **format** option. Finally, synchronize one axis with another using the [synchronizedValue](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/valueAxis/#synchronizedValue) option, as demonstrated in the code below.

This tutorial explained how to implement a chart with two axes and one pane, but in some cases, you may need to use two or more panes. For further information on this subject, refer to the [Create a Multi-Pane Chart](/Documentation/Tutorial/Data_Visualization/Create_a_Multi-Pane_Chart/#Create_a_Multi-Pane_Chart) tutorial.
