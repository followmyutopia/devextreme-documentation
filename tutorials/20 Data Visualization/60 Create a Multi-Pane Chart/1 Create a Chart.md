Add a multi-series **Chart** widget to your page. To learn how to configure charts, refer to the [Configure Charts](/Documentation/Tutorial/Data_Visualization/Configure_Charts/) tutorial.

In this tutorial, the data source contains information about temperature (average, minimum and maximum values) and precipitation in a certain region over a year. You can classify this information into three data series. Specify them with the objects of the [series](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/series/) array. For detailed instructions, see the [Bind Series to Data](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Chart/Data_Binding/Bind_Series_to_Data/) topic.

In the result, the **Chart** widget displays all the series on one pane. Such configuration makes the widget seem overloaded by visual elements. The next step shows how to allot an extra pane for a series to make the chart easier to read.
