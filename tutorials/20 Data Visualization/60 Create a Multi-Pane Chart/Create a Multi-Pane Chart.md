This tutorial provides detailed instructions on how to configure the [Chart](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/) widget that displays several data series on different panes. Following the steps of this tutorial, you will learn to bind data series to panes. As a result, you will get the **Chart** widget with two panes, each of which will be associated with one or multiple series.
