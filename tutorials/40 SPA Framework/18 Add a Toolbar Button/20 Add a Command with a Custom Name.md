Add one more command to the view's markup. Set a custom identifier for it, e.g., "Add". Since there is no such command in [default command mapping](/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Built-in_Layouts/#Default_Command_Mapping), specify a place for your command on a toolbar manually. To do so, specify the [commandMapping](/Documentation/ApiReference/SPA_Framework/HtmlApplication/Configuration/#commandMapping) configuration option of the **HtmlApplication** object in this *index.js* file. Observe the command containers that are exposed by the [predefined layouts](/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Built-in_Layouts/) that you use in this application, and specify a proper place for your command within these containers. This is demonstrated in the *index.js* file below. Refer to the [commandMapping](/Documentation/ApiReference/SPA_Framework/HtmlApplication/Configuration/#commandMapping) configuration option description to learn which options you can set for a command in addition to its location.
