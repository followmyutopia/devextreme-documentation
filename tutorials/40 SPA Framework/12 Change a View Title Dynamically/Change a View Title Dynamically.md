When [defining a view HTML template](/Documentation/Tutorial/SPA_Framework/Your_First_Application/#Create_a_View), you can set a view title using the [title](/Documentation/ApiReference/SPA_Framework/Markup_Components/dxView/Configuration/#title) option of the **dxView** markup component representing this view.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to make a view title that changes dynamically.
