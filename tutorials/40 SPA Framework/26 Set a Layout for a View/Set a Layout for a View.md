While the DevExtreme framework supplies several ready-to-use [layout sets](/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Built-in_Layouts/#Ready-to-Use_Layout_Sets), you can set a custom layout set for your application. For this purpose, specify a context for each layout controller from your layout set. The [Use a Custom Layout Set](/Documentation/Tutorial/SPA_Framework/Use_a_Custom_Layout_Set/#Use_a_Custom_Layout_Set) tutorial demonstrates how to define a custom layout set, in which one of the layout controllers is used for the Android platform only. In some cases, you may need to use a particular layout for a specific view only. But a view cannot be specified as a context in the same manner as a target platform. The approach that should be used for this task is detailed in this tutorial. The [Empty](/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Built-in_Layouts/#Empty_Layout) layout will be used for the "about" view.
