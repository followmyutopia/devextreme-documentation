This tutorial presents an example of how you can implement the 'login' functionality in a DevExtreme application. An application that will be implemented in this tutorial will have one of the root views and one child view secured. When navigating to a secured view, a popup modal view will be invoked. An end user will have to specify login parameters to login and navigate to the target view or cancel navigation.
