Similar to toolbar buttons that are described in the [Add a Toolbar Button](/Documentation/Tutorial/SPA_Framework/Add_a_Toolbar_Button/#Add_a_Toolbar_Button) tutorial, menu items are also [commands](/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Views_and_Layouts/#Add_Commands_to_Views), but they are presented by menu items in a UI. A menu is displayed by a drop-down menu or the [Popover](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxPopover/), [ActionSheet](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxActionSheet/), [application bar](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/ff431813(v=vs.105).aspx) widget based on the device on which the application is running. However, you don't have to concern yourself with this. Instead, denote a command as a menu. In this tutorial, you will learn how to do this.
