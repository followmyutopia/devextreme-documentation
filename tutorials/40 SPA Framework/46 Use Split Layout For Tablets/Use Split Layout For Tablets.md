In mobile applications, content is typically divided between a list view and a detail view. Although this approach is appropriate when applications are running on phones, it becomes unusable when applications are running on tablets. Since there is more space on a tablet screen, the views designed for phones do not fill the bigger tablet screens. A solution for tablet applications is to place both the list and detail views on one screen. The predefined [Split](/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Built-in_Layouts/#Split_Layout) layout implements this approach and uses a tablet screen space more efficiently. There are two panes in this layout. The left one is a master pane. It presents a list of items. The pane on the right side is a detail pane. It presents detail information about the item selected in the right pane. In this tutorial, you will learn how to implement an application using the **Split** layout.
