Global navigation commands are the commands that are created based on the configuration options provided via the [navigation](/Documentation/ApiReference/SPA_Framework/HtmlApplication/Configuration/#navigation) option of the **HtmlApplication** object. When using such layouts as [Navbar](/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Built-in_Layouts/#Navbar_Layout) or [SlideOut](/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Built-in_Layouts/#SlideOut_Layout), navigation commands are displayed by a special widget added to a layout markup. This widget is marked as a 'global-navigation' [command container](/Documentation/ApiReference/SPA_Framework/Markup_Components/dxCommandContainer/). But there can be applications that use the layouts that do not provide such a command container for navigation commands. In this instance, you have to implement this command container in your application manually. This tutorial demonstrates one of the possible approaches to display global navigation commands. A 'navigation' view will be added to the application. In this view, the [List](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxList/) widget will serve as a 'global-navigation' command container.
