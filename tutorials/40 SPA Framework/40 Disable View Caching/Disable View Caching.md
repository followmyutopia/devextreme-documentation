To avoid recreating views each time they are displayed in an application, views are cached once when displayed. You can prevent view caching by setting the [disableViewCache](/Documentation/ApiReference/SPA_Framework/HtmlApplication/Configuration/#disableViewCache) configuration option of the **HtmlApplication** object. In addition, you can disable caching of a particular view only. For this purpose, set the [disableCache](/Documentation/ApiReference/SPA_Framework/Markup_Components/dxView/Configuration/#disableCache) option for the required view to *true*. In this tutorial, you will learn how to do this.
