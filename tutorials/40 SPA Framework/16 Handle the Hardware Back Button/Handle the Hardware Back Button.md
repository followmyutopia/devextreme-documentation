In the [Navigate Forward and Backwards to a View](/Documentation/Tutorial/SPA_Framework/Navigate_Forward_and_Backwards_to_a_View/#Navigate_Forward_and_Backwards_to_a_View) tutorial, you learned that the Back button is added automatically to a view when there is a previous view in the current navigation stack. However, there may be a hardware Back button on a device, and this button should be handled in the same way as the Back button that is added to the application. In this tutorial, you will learn how to handle a hardware Back button.
