While navigating from a view to a view in an application built using the DevExtreme framework, views are cached once displayed. This saves the time required to create a view each time it is displayed. In some scenarios, you may need to remove a view from the cache. For this purpose, the **htmlApplication** object provides access to the [ViewCache](/Documentation/ApiReference/SPA_Framework/ViewCache/) object. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use it. If you need to disable caching for a particular view, refer to the [Disable View Caching](/Documentation/Tutorial/SPA_Framework/Disable_View_Caching/) tutorial.
