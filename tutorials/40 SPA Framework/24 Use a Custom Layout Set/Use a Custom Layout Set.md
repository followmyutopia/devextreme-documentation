The DevExtreme framework comes with several [ready-to-use layout sets](/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Built-in_Layouts/#Ready-to-Use_Layout_Sets). These layout sets are appropriate for typical applications. At the same time, you can define a custom layout set to be used in a non-typical scenario. In this tutorial, a custom layout set will be introduced. It will consist of [predefined DevExtreme layouts](/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Built-in_Layouts/#Built-in_Layouts), but different layouts will be specified for different platforms.
