The DevExtreme framework supplies several [predefined layouts](/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Built-in_Layouts/#Built-in_Layouts) that are suitable for most uses. However, these layouts may not be appropriate in some applications. In this case, you can customize the predefined layouts or implement a custom one.
