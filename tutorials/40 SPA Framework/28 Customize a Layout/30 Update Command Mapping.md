Since the added toolbar is declared as a command container, add several [commands](/Documentation/ApiReference/SPA_Framework/Markup_Components/dxCommand/) to the application views and place them within this toolbar. For this purpose, extend the application's [command mapping](/Documentation/ApiReference/SPA_Framework/HtmlApplication/Configuration/#commandMapping). To learn how to add commands and map them to command containers, refer to the [Add a Toolbar Button](/Documentation/Tutorial/SPA_Framework/Add_a_Toolbar_Button/#Add_a_Toolbar_Button) tutorial.
