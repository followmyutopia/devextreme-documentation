This tutorial will show you how to add a navigation bar to a DevExtreme application. The navigation bar serves as global navigation in an application. When pressing a navbar item, an end user navigates to the view that is associated with this item. The views that are available from a navbar are called "root views" in the framework. They are always accessible for end-users.
