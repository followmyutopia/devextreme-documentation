  - Use an [application project template](/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Application_Project/) to create a DevExtreme application.
  You can find the application template in the **Application Template** folder of the [DevExtreme Mobile](/Documentation/Guide/Common/DevExtreme_Packages/#DevExtreme_Mobile)/[DevExtreme Web](/Documentation/Guide/Common/DevExtreme_Packages/#DevExtreme_Mobile) zip archive. If you have [DevExtreme Complete](/Documentation/Guide/Common/DevExtreme_Packages/#DevExtreme_Complete) installed, use the [Basic Template](/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Project_Templates/#Basic_Application) that is provided with the Visual Studio templates.

  - Run the application in a browser.
  Use any web server (Apache HTTP Server, IIS or any other). For details on application running, refer to the [Running](/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Application_Development/#Running) topic.
