This tutorial will show you how to add a slide out menu to a DevExtreme application. The menu will serve as a global navigation control in an application. When pressing a menu item, an end user navigates to the view that is associated with this item. The views that are available from a slide out menu are called "root views" in the framework. They are always accessible for end-users.
