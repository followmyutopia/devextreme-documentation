[note]This article describes an application template for IDEs other than Visual Studio. Templates for Visual Studio are described in the **VS Integration** | [Project Templates](/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Project_Templates/) section.

The [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) library provides data binding facilities, but you still need a framework to manage the view navigation and rendering. In Knockout-based mobile applications, our own DevExtreme SPA Framework takes over these duties.

The DevExtreme SPA Framework is a rather broad topic. That is the reason why a [whole section of our documentation](/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/) is dedicated to it. If you are after the information on the Knockout application template particularly, see the **SPA Framework** | [Application Project](/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Application_Project/) article.
