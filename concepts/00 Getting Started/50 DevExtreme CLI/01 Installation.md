    npm i -g devextreme-cli

Alternatively, you can use npx to execute DevExtreme CLI commands without installing the CLI globally. Examples in this article illustrate both approaches.

[note] npx is available with npm v5.2 and later. If you have an earlier version, [upgrade npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/try-the-latest-stable-version-of-npm).
