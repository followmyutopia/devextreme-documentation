DevExtreme provides two Vue component libraries: [DevExtreme Vue Wrappers](https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-vue/blob/master/README.md) and [DevExtreme Reactive Components](https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-reactive/blob/master/README.md#business-components-for-vue).

DevExtreme Vue Wrappers allow using the existing 65+ DevExtreme widgets in Vue projects. The wrappers and the widgets have the same APIs, feature sets, and limitations. Unlike the wrappers, DevExtreme Reactive Components are native Vue components. They include only the [DevExtreme Vue Grid](https://devexpress.github.io/devextreme-reactive/vue/grid/) as of now.

Both the wrappers and the native components are at the Community Technology Preview (CTP) development stage. That means that the products are available for testing, but their concept, design and behavior can be reconsidered and changed without notice.
