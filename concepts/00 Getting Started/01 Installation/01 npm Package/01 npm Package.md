Run the following command to install the [main DevExtreme package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/devextreme)'s major release version:

    npm install devextreme@19.1 --save --save-exact

DevExtreme also provides [packages](https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme/releases) that contain hotfixes and new features for early testing. Run the following command to install the latest published version (a stable or a pre-release version):

    npm install devextreme@19.1-next --save --save-exact

[note] We recommend saving an exact version of DevExtreme to avoid unexpected updates because DevExtreme does not use Semantic Versioning. In our versioning system, the first and middle numbers indicate a major release which may contain behavior changes.

You need additional npm packages to use DevExtreme with Angular, Vue or React. See the following instructions: [Angular](/Documentation/Guide/Angular_Components/Getting_Started/Add_DevExtreme_to_an_Angular_CLI_Application/), [Vue](https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-vue#install-devextreme), [React](/Documentation/Guide/React_Components/Add_DevExtreme_to_a_React_Application/).
