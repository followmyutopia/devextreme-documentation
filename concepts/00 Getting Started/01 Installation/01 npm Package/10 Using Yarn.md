All npm DevExtreme packages can be installed using Yarn. Run the following command to install the main DevExtreme package:

    yarn add devextreme@19.2 --exact

The following command installs the latest published version (a stable or a pre-release version):

    yarn add devextreme@19.2-next --exact

You should also install packages for [Angular](/Documentation/Guide/Angular_Components/Getting_Started/Add_DevExtreme_to_an_Angular_CLI_Application/), <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-vue#install-devextreme" target="_blank">Vue</a>, or [React](/Documentation/Guide/React_Components/Add_DevExtreme_to_a_React_Application/) if you are going to use DevExtreme components with these frameworks.
