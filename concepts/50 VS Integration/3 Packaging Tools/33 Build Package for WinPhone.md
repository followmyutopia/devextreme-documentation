As you were developing this application, you included layouts and style sheets specific to the WinPhone platform. The next step is to set the project properties required for building a native Windows Phone package. To do this, right-click the application project in the Visual Studio Solution Explorer and choose **Properties**, then specify the properties that are presented in the **Windows Phone package** tab.

- **Signing**  

    Specify a path to the *.pfx* file used to sign the application package.

- **Packaging**  

    These properties are analogous to the properties from the [app manifest file for the Windows Phone](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/ff769509(v=vs.105).aspx#BKMK_APPelement).

- **App Icons and Images**

    Assign the icons and splash images to be built into the application's native package. To learn about image recommendations, refer to the [Tile design guidelines for the Windows Phone](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/design/jj662929(v=vs.105).aspx) article.

- **Package localization**  

    If you [localize your application](/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Localization/), specify the application's languages so that they are available for end users in the Windows Phone Store.

- **Application Template**

    Specify a [custom PhoneGap application template](/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Packaging_Tools/#Build_Custom_PhoneGap_Application_Template) for the Windows Phone native package. When going through the **Build Package** wizard, this template will be used as a base for building a native package for the application.

Now, you can easily create a native Windows Phone package with your application right from Visual Studio. Right-click the application project and choose **Build Native Packages...**. The **Build Package** wizard will run.

Choose **Windows Phone** and go through all the wizard steps. As a result, you will get a file that is ready to be loaded to the Windows Store.
