To standardize application code in terms of naming and structure and simplify the process of creating applications, DevExtreme comes with application templates integrated into Visual Studio. Using these templates, you will create mobile applications more quickly.

To create a project using one of the DevExtreme templates, select **File** | **New** | **Project...** from the Visual Studio main menu. This will take you to the **New Project** dialog.
