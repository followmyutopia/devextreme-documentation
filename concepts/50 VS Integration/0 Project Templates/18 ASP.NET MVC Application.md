To create an ASP.NET MVC application that involves DevExtreme widgets, use the **ASP.NET MVC 5 Application** project template. It allows you to employ [DevExtreme ASP.NET MVC Wrappers](/Documentation/Guide/ASP.NET_MVC_Wrappers/Fundamentals/) for configuring DevExtreme widgets.

Folders in this project template have a structure [typical for an ASP.NET MVC application](http://www.w3schools.com/aspnet/mvc_folders.asp). Their standard contents are extended by scripts, libraries and stylesheets required by DevExtreme ASP.NET MVC Wrappers and DevExtreme itself.
