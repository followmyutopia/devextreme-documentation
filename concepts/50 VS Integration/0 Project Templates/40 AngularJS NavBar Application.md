**AngularJS NavBar Application** is a project template for building an HTML/JS application based on the [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) framework and [DevExtreme widgets](/Documentation/Guide/Common/Introduction_to_DevExtreme/#Mobile_Development/Overview/UI_Widgets_Library). In this project template, the [NavBar](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxNavBar/) widget is used as a global navigation control.

This application structure is detailed in the [AngularJS Approach](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Widgets/Basics/Application_Templates/#Mobile_Application/Angular_Approach) topic of the [Application Templates](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Widgets/Basics/Application_Templates/#Application_Templates) article.

Generally, the basic project template is the minimum requirement for starting to build an application. You can then extend the project as required.

The application created using the **AngularJS NavBar Application** template can be built for desktop or packaged for iOS, Android, WinPhone and PhoneGap. For details, refer to the [Packaging Tools](/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Packaging_Tools/) documentation section.
