This project is created when you choose **WinPhone** in the DevExtreme Project Wizard and is intended for building mobile applications for the WinPhone platform. This project is created using a standard template for WinPhone applications. The [Mobile](/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Project_Templates/#Mobile_Project) project, however, is linked to its **www** folder. All the files in this folder represent links to corresponding files in the **Mobile** project. Use the **Mobile** project to create an application for WinPhone, but build the **WinPhone** project for deployment to the device.

To package an application created using the Win8Phone project, use procedures standard for WinPhone VS projects [Packaging your Windows Store app using Visual Studio 2012](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh454036)).
