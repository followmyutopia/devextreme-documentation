The *.dxView* files are the HTML files that can be opened using the **View Designer**. To learn more about the View Designer, refer to the [Design-Time Features](/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Design-Time_Features/) documentation section.

The *app.config.js* file includes the configuration object used to initialize the [application object](/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Application_Project/#Application_Object). 

Generally, the basic project template is the minimum requirement for starting to build an application. You can then extend the project as required.

The application created using the **Basic Application** template can be built for the desktop or packaged for iOS, Android, WinPhone and PhoneGap. For details, refer to the [Packaging Tools](/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Packaging_Tools/) documentation section.
