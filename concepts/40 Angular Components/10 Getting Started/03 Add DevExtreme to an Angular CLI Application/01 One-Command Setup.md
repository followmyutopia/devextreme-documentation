You can install and configure DevExtreme and its dependencies with a single npx command that is part of the [DevExtreme CLI](/Documentation/Guide/Getting_Started/DevExtreme_CLI/):

    npx -p devextreme-cli devextreme add devextreme-angular

[note]

npx is available with npm v5.2 and later. If you have an earlier version, [upgrade npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/try-the-latest-stable-version-of-npm) or install the DevExtreme CLI globally and run the command from the installed package:

    npm i -g devextreme-cli
    devextreme add devextreme-angular

[/note]

After you run the command, you can skip the following articles and move on straight to [importing DevExtreme modules](/Documentation/Guide/Angular_Components/Getting_Started/Using_an_Angular_CLI_Application/#Import_DevExtreme_Modules).

If the command is unavailable for any reason, follow the instructions below for manual setup.
