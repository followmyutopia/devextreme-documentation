You can use one of the two approaches to provide data for **Chart**, **PieChart** or **Sparkline**. The first is declaring an array of plain objects and using it as a data source. For more information on this approach, see the [Using an Array of Objects](/Documentation/Guide/Data_Visualization/Charts/Data_Binding/#Provide_Data/Using_an_Array_of_Objects) topic. The second is implementing a data source using the [data library](/Documentation/Guide/Data_Layer/Data_Layer/). With its new level of sophistication, this approach brings you the privileges and flexibility not before seen in primitive arrays. This approach is discussed in greater detail in the [Using the Data Library](/Documentation/Guide/Data_Visualization/Charts/Data_Binding/#Provide_Data/Using_the_Data_Library) topic.
