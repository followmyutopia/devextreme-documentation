This example shows how data in the **Chart** and **PieChart** widgets can be updated using the Data Library. Here, these widgets are bound to a DataSource object. When you click one of the buttons located below the widgets, an ArrayStore that lies under the DataSource object is updated.  The **load()** method of the DataSource object must be called in order for widgets reflect changes made in the ArrayStore.
