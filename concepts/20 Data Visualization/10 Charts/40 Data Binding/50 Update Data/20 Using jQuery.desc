This example shows how data in the **Chart** and **PieChart** widget can be updated. Here, these widgets have the same data source. When you click one of the buttons located below the widgets, this data source is updated. To make the widgets reflect changes made in the data source, the data source must be rebound to the widgets. This is performed using the **option()** method of the widget instance.
