[note]At the time of version 16.1, DevExtreme ASP.NET MVC Wrappers were in the Community Technology Preview (CTP) status. Currently, this product changed its status to Release Candidate (RC). Renewed documentation is available since [version 16.2](/Documentation/16_2/Guide/ASP.NET_MVC_Wrappers/Data_Binding/).

All DevExtreme widgets that operate with data collections have the `DataSource()` method, which configures data access for the widget. This topic provides an overview of data sources accepted by this method.
