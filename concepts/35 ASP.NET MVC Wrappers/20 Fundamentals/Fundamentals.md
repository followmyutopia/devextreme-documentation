[note]At the time of version 16.1, DevExtreme ASP.NET MVC Wrappers were in the Community Technology Preview (CTP) status. Currently, this product changed its status to Release Candidate (RC). Renewed documentation is available since [version 16.2](/Documentation/16_2/Guide/ASP.NET_MVC_Wrappers/Fundamentals/).

DevExtreme ASP.NET MVC Wrappers are a set of server-side wrappers that allow you to configure JavaScript-based DevExtreme widgets using familiar [Razor C# syntax](http://www.w3schools.com/aspnet/razor_syntax.asp). The Razor constructions are rendered into the HTML and JavaScript needed to initialize a DevExtreme widget.
