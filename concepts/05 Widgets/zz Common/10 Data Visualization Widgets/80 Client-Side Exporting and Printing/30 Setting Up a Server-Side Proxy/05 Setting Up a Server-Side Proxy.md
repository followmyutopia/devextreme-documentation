[important]The functionality described in this guide is no longer required since all the modern browsers implement APIs for saving files.

If your application will be used in browsers that do not implement an API for saving files (for instance, **Safari on Mac OS** before version 10) and you need the exporting feature to work correctly, you can implement a server-side proxy, which will stream the file back to an end user in response to a POST request. The proxy implementation is different for each platform.
