If your application will be used in browsers that do not implement an API for saving files (for instance, **IE9** and **Safari on Mac OS**) and you need the exporting feature to work correctly, you can implement a server-side proxy, which will stream the file back to an end user in response to a POST request. The proxy implementation is different for each platform.
