DevExtreme comes with ready-to-use predefined dictionaries. These dictionaries include all the captions, titles and messages that are used in DevExtreme UI widgets. DevExtreme includes the following dictionary files providing the localization of desktop, mobile and multi-purpose UI widgets for the **ru**, **ja**, **de** and **en** locales, respectively.

- *dx.messages.ru.js*  
- *dx.messages.ja.js*  
- *dx.messages.de.js*  
- *dx.messages.en.js*  

[note]You are not required to link the "en" locale dictionary because it is already included in DevExtreme libraries. You can use the **dx.messages.en.js** dictionary to create custom dictionaries for other locales based on this dictionary.

The predefined dictionaries are available in the **[Sources]/Lib/js/localization** folder within the DevExtreme zip archive or in the folder where you have installed DevExtreme.
