The range selector's scale indicates values that lie within scale boundaries. When a range selector is created using a [data source](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxRangeSelector/Configuration/#dataSource), the scale boundaries are being defined automatically. However, you can define them explicitly using the [startValue](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxRangeSelector/Configuration/scale/#startValue) and [endValue](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxRangeSelector/Configuration/scale/#endValue) options.

This section describes the elements that the range selector's scale consists of. To configure these elements, use the options of the [scale](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxRangeSelector/Configuration/scale/) object.
