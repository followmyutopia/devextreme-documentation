You can move a selected range along the scale by a click. The area where you click should be unselected. By default, this capability is enabled. To disable it, set the **behavior**.[moveSelectedRangeByClick](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxRangeSelector/Configuration/behavior/#moveSelectedRangeByClick) option to **false**.

Moreover, you can move a selected range by dragging it. Click the selected area on the scale and drag it to the required place.
