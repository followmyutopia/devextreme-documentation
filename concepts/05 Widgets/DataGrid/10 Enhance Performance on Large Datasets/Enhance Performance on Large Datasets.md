Working with large datasets may lower the **DataGrid**'s performance. Consider using remote data sources to enhance it:

- [JSON](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Data_Binding/JSON_Data/)
- [OData](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Data_Binding/OData_Service/)

Use a [custom source](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Data_Binding/Custom_Sources/) if you need to get full control over all data processing operations such as [filtering](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Filtering_and_Searching/), [sorting](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Sorting/), [paging](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Paging/), [grouping](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Grouping/) and [summary calculation](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Summaries/). Then, depending on the required functionality, you may use the features described below to speed up the process.
