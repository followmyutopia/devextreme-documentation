A single mode is preferable when you only need one grid row to be selected at a time. To select a row in this mode, an end-user must click this row. When a user clicks another row, the formerly selected one becomes unselected.

Additionally, a selected row can be deselected by a mouse click as you press the CTRL key. For information on keyboard shortcuts in **DataGrid**, see the [Keyboard Navigation](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Keyboard_Support/) and [Selecting Using Keyboard Shortcuts](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Selection/#Selecting_Using_Keyboard_Shortcuts) topics.

The animation below demonstrates how to perform selection in a single mode.
