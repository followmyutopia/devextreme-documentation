In a multiple selection mode, a user can employ keyboard shortcuts to select rows. The following shortcuts are supported.

<div class="simple-table">
<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Shortcut</th>
    <th>Action</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>CTRL+Click</td>
    <td>Selects the clicked row.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SHIFT+Click</td>
    <td>Selects a range of rows.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CTRL+A</td>
    <td>Selects all rows. Make sure that the <a href="/Documentation/17_2/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/selection/#allowSelectAll">allowSelectAll</a> option is <i>true</i>.</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

[note]On rare occasions, when *virtual* scrolling mode is used, selection made with *SHIFT+Click* may be reset. This is explained by the technical peculiarities of this mode. See the [Vertical Scrolling](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Data_Navigation/#Scrolling/Vertical_Scrolling) article for more details.

For an overview of all key combinations presented in **DataGrid**, refer to the [Keyboard Navigation](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Keyboard_Support/) article.
