Access to a custom data source is configured using the [CustomStore](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/CustomStore/) component. DevExtreme provides [ASP.NET](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Data_Binding/Web_API_Service/) and [PHP](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Data_Binding/PHP_Service/) extensions to configure the **CustomStore** and implement server-side data processing. You can also use the third-party extension for [MongoDB](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Data_Binding/MongoDB_Service/). If these extensions are not suitable, use the instructions below to configure the **CustomStore** manually.
