The **Diagram** widget provides a visual interface to help you design new and modify existing diagrams. 

[note] At this time, the **Diagram** is available as a community technology preview (CTP) version. You can test the widget and share your feedback to influence our R&D process. We do not recommend that you use the Diagram in production environments because of possible implementation issues and a high chance of breaking changes in subsequent versions.
