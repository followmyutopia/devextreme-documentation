When modifying a format, you can change the markup tag associated with it and limit format values. Refer to the [get(componentPath)](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxHtmlEditor/Methods/#getcomponentPath) description to see a code example.

Module modification is also possible but can cause the module to malfunction.
