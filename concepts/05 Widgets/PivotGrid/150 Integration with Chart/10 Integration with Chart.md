**PivotGrid** visualizes large amounts of data that are numeric - this can be hard to understand. To make your data more clear to a viewer, visualize it in the [Chart](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/) widget. To bind these two widgets together, **PivotGrid** exposes the [bindChart(chart, integrationOptions)](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxPivotGrid/Methods/#bindChartchart_integrationOptions) method. This article dives deep into the capabilities of this method.
