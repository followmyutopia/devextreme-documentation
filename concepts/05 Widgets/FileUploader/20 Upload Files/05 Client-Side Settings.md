Depending on the [uploadMode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxFileUploader/Configuration/#uploadMode) you choose, the **FileUploader** widget uploads files using an [HTML form](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp) or using the [FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/FormData) interface and a series of [Ajax](http://www.w3schools.com/ajax/default.asp) requests. The **uploadMode** option accepts one of the following values.

- *"instantly"* (default)   
Ajax upload. Files are uploaded instantly after they are selected.

- *"useButtons"*  
Ajax upload. Files are uploaded after a user clicks the **Upload** button.

- *"useForm"*  
HTML form upload. Files are uploaded when the HTML form is submitted.

[note]Because Internet Explorer 9 does not support the [FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/FormData) interface, you can only upload files using the HTML form in this browser.

The following examples show how to configure the **FileUploader** for uploading files using Ajax requests and using an HTML form. Note that in both cases, the [name](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxFileUploader/Configuration/#name) option is specified, so that the uploaded files can be accessed on the server.

- **Ajax upload**

        <!--HTML--><div id="fileUploaderContainer"></div>

    <!---->

        <!--JavaScript-->$(function() {
            $("#fileUploaderContainer").dxFileUploader({
                name: "file",
                // Uncomment the following line to allow a user to upload multiple files
                // multiple: true,
                uploadMode: "useButtons", // or "instantly"
                uploadUrl: "/upload.php"
            });
        });
<!---->

- **HTML form upload**

    <!---->

        <!--HTML--><form action="/upload.php" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
            <div id="fileUploaderContainer"></div>
            <input type="submit">
        </form>

    <!---->

        <!--JavaScript-->$(function() {
            $("#fileUploaderContainer").dxFileUploader({
                name: "file",
                // Uncomment the following lines to allow a user to upload multiple files
                // multiple: true,
                // name: "files[]",
                uploadMode: "useForm"
            });
        });

[note] If you allow a user to upload multiple files using an HTML form, the value of the **name** option must end with square brackets as shown in the commented-out code line in the example above.
