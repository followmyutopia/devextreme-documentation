The **month** view displays appointments scheduled to a month. The **Scheduler** widget arranges appointments from left to right. The size of an appointment depends on its duration in days. Even if an appointment lasts only for several hours or minutes, it occupies the entire day cell. The time scale and all-day panel are not available in this view.

By default, a day cell holds one or two appointments; all others are shown collapsed.

When collapsed appointments occupy more than 75% of a cell width, they all are aggregated in an appointment collector. It has a default color, but if collapsed appointments are associated with the same resource, the collector has the color of this resource.

To view associated appointments, a user should click the appointment collector.

If you [group appointments by resources](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Scheduler/Resources/Group_Appointments_by_Resources/), the resource headers are located above the day scale.
