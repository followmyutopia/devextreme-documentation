Appointments can be modified by end users in the UI and programmatically in code.

####Modify Appointments in UI####

You can modify an appointment using one of the following techniques.

- To change an appointment's start and end date/time, move the appointment by dragging it to another place within the scheduler view. 

- To change an appointment's start or end time, stretch or tighten the appointment by dragging its top/bottom border within the scheduler timetable column. 

- To change appointment details, click the appointment and then click the **Open appointment** button. In the invoked popup window, apply the required modifications.

All the modifications are saved to the [bound data source](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Scheduler/Appointments/#Provide_a_Data_Source).

</div>

[note]By default, when you are working with an appointment using a UI, the fields displaying start date and end date timezones are not available. To show them, you can add the following code to the scheduler's options.

    <!--JavaScript-->
    var schedulerOptions = {
        . . .
        onAppointmentFormCreated: function(arg) {
            var form = arg.form;
            form.itemOption("startDateTimeZone", { visible: true });
            form.itemOption("endDateTimeZone", { visible: true });
        }
    }

[note]When you are modifying a recurring appointment using a UI, the Scheduler prompts you to edit only the active appointment or the entire series.

By default, if you are modifying a recurring appointment using a UI, the widget displays a dialog that prompts you to edit only the active appointment or the entire series. To change this behavior, assign the required value to the [recurrenceEditMode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxScheduler/Configuration/#recurrenceEditMode) option. The option accepts the following values.

- **dialog**  
Displays a dialog that suggests to a user to choose between editing an entire series or only the current appointment.
- **series**  
Enables an end-user to edit only the entire appointment series.
- **occurrence**  
Enables an end-user to edit only the current appointment.

####Modify Appointments in Code####

To modify an appointment in code, use the widget's [updateAppointment(target, appointment)](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxScheduler/Methods/#updateAppointmenttarget_appointment) method passing the appointment object to be updated and an updated appointment object as parameters. This method updates the appointment in the bound [data source](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Scheduler/Appointments/#Provide_a_Data_Source).

In addition, you can handle the [appointmentUpdating](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxScheduler/Events/#appointmentUpdating) and [appointmnetUpdated](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxScheduler/Events/#appointmentUpdated) events raised before and after you insert an updated appointment to the data source.
