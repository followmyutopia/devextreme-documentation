In real-life scheduling applications, appointments are seldom processed simply "as is", and are usually assigned to different resources. There are different kinds of resources, and the decision as to what should be a resource in a particular scheduling application depends upon the specifics of the task solved by the application. Here are some examples of scheduling tasks, illustrating what can be an appointment and a resource in these examples.

- *A Business*.  
Resource: Every employee in this company.  
Appointment: Any time interval spent by an employee to perform a particular task.  
- *A Car Rental Agency*.  
Resource: Every car which is owned by this firm, and can be leased.  
Appointment: Any time interval when any of the firm's cars are leased.
- *An Educational Center*.  
Resources: Every teacher who works at this center, or every room in this center.  
Appointment: Any time interval when any of the teachers are delivering a lecture in any of the rooms at the center.
