In this example, the map is initially zoomed 3 times using the [zoomFactor](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxVectorMap/Configuration#zoomFactor) option. Then, each time you perform zooming, the updated value of the zoom factor appears under the map. This behavior is accomplished by implementing the [zoomChanged](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxVectorMap/Configuration#zoomChanged) callback function.
