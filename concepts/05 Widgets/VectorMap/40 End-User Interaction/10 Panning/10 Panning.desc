In this example, the map is initially centered on Chicago using the [center](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxVectorMap/Configuration#center) option. Then, each time you pan, the updated coordinates of the center appear under the map. This behavior is accomplished by implementing the [onCenterChanged](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxVectorMap/Configuration#onCenterChanged) callback function.
