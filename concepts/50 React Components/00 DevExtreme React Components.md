[note] DevExtreme provides two React component libraries: DevExtreme React Components, which are wrappers over DevExtreme widgets, described here and [DevExtreme Reactive Components](https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-reactive/blob/master/README.md). Refer to [this blog post](https://community.devexpress.com/blogs/oliver/archive/2018/04/20/devextreme-new-react-wrappers-vs-native-react-components.aspx) for a detailed comparison of the two libraries.

The DevExtreme React Component Suite is a feature-complete set of 65+ responsive and touch-enabled UI components for React applications. The suite includes a data grid, interactive charts, data editors, navigation and multi-purpose widgets.

The DevExtreme React Component Suite provides the following platform-specific features:

- [Controlled](/Documentation/Guide/React_Components/State_Management/#Controlled_Mode) and [uncontrolled](/Documentation/Guide/React_Components/State_Management/#Uncontrolled_Mode) state management modes

- [Declarative configuration syntax](/Documentation/Guide/React_Components/Component_Configuration_Syntax/)

- [TypeScript support](/Documentation/Guide/React_Components/TypeScript_Support/)

All DevExtreme component suites, including React, share architecture and core features. The following core features are common to all suites:

- [Data layer](/Documentation/Guide/Data_Layer/Data_Layer/)

- [Client-side data validation](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Common/UI_Widgets/Data_Validation/)

- [Themes and styles](/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/Predefined_Themes/)

- [Localization](/Documentation/Guide/Common/Localization/)

- [Modularity](/Documentation/Guide/Common/Modularity/Link_Modules/)

- [Customization using templates](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Common/Templates/)

We also provide [over 250 technical demos](/Demos/WidgetsGallery/) you can edit and copy code from.

For information on how to integrate DevExtreme React components into your application, refer to one of the [Add DevExtreme to a React Application](/Documentation/Guide/React_Components/Add_DevExtreme_to_a_React_Application/) article.
