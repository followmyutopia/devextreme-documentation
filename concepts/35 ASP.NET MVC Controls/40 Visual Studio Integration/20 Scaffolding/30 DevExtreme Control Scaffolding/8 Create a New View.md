You can also create a new view with a scaffolded DevExtreme control on it. It is an MVC view or a Razor page, depending on the type of project.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the folder in which to place the view. On the invoked menu, point to **Add** and then click **View...**/**Razor Page...** or **New Scaffolded Item...**.

2. In the **Add Scaffold** window, choose **MVC View with a DevExtreme Control** or **Razor Page with a DevExtreme Control** and click **Add**.

3. In the wizard, follow the configuration steps, which include entering the view's name, choosing the DevExtreme control to scaffold, and configuring data binding and related settings. At the last step, click **Add** to finish the scaffolding.

Finally, reference the view as a partial view or use it as a separate page.

[note] Scaffolding is implemented for major controls. You can configure a missing control manually using the [Fundamentals](/Documentation/Guide/ASP.NET_MVC_Controls/Fundamentals/) article's instructions.
