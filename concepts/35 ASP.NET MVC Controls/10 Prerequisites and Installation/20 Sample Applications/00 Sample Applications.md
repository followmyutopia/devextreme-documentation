DevExtreme ASP.NET MVC Controls come with sample applications that you can find in the C:\Users\Public\Public Documents\DevExpress Demos 18.2\DevExtreme\ASP.NET MVC Controls\ directory.

The WidgetsGallery folder contains two applications that show how to configure most controls in the DevExtreme library. They demonstrate identical use-cases, but one of them is built using ASP.NET MVC 5, while the other targets ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0.

The DevAV folder contains a real-world application demo built using ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0. You can view its online version [here](/Demos/DevAV/).
