You can import an existing theme from DevExtreme metadata [saved beforehand](/concepts/60%20Themes%20and%20Styles/08%20ThemeBuilder/20%20Postpone%20Customization.md '/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/ThemeBuilder/#Postpone_Customization') or from Bootstrap variables. Follow the steps below to do that in the wizard:

1. Click **Import a Theme**.

2. Choose whether to import a theme from DevExtreme metadata or Bootstrap variables.

3. To import DevExtreme metadata, upload a `.json` file with the metadata or paste the metadata in the text area.  

    To import Bootstrap variables, upload a `variables.less` for Bootstrap 3 or `_variables.scss` file for Bootstrap 4. The ThemeBuilder uses colors from the variables to create a theme that is consistent with the Bootstrap theme. 

After you import a theme, the wizard navigates to the main view for [additional theme customization](/concepts/60%20Themes%20and%20Styles/08%20ThemeBuilder/10%20Customize%20the%20Theme.md '/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/ThemeBuilder/#Customize_the_Theme').
