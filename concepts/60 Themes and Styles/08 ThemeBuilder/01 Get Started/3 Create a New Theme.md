2. Select a base theme: Generic or Material.

3. Select a color scheme and change basic appearance settings.

4. If the appearance on the preview meets you requirements, click **Export** to [export the theme](/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/ThemeBuilder/#Export_the_Resulting_Theme). Otherwise, click **Advanced Settings** to navigate to the main view for [additional customization](/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/ThemeBuilder/#Customize_the_Theme).
