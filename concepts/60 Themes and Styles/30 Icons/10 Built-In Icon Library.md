DevExtreme comes with an icon library that provides font icons for all DevExtreme themes. You can use the icons [in widgets](/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/Icons/#Icons_in_Widgets) and [in other page elements](/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/Icons/#Icons_in_Other_HTML_Elements) as they are or [customize them](/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/Icons/#Customize_Icons).

Available icons are presented below:

<div class="simulator-desktop-container" data-view="/Content/Applications/18_2/Icons/markup.html, /Content/Applications/18_2/Icons/script.js, /Content/Applications/18_2/Icons/styles.css"></div>
