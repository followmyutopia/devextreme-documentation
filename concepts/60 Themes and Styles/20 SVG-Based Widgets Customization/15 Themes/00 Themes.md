Unlike CSS themes, which are collections of CSS classes, SVG themes are widget configurations. However, all [predefined CSS themes](/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/Predefined_Themes/) have SVG counterparts. This allows HTML- and SVG-based widgets to have a uniform appearance when they are displayed on the same page.

If you already use a predefined CSS theme on the page, a corresponding SVG theme is applied automatically. Otherwise, you need to [apply the SVG theme](/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/SVG-Based_Widgets_Customization/#Themes/Apply_a_Theme). 

You can also [create custom SVG themes](/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/SVG-Based_Widgets_Customization/#Themes/Create_a_Custom_Theme).
