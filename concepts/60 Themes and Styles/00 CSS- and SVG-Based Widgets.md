Widgets from the DevExtreme library are divided into CSS-based and SVG-based. Styling methods depend on the widget's group.

The following widgets are SVG-based:

- [BarGauge](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/BarGauge/Visual_Elements/)
- [Bullet](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Bullet/Visual_Elements/)
- [Chart](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Chart/Overview/)
- [CircularGauge](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/CircularGauge/Visual_Elements/)
- [Funnel](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Funnel/Overview/)
- [LinearGauge](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/LinearGauge/Visual_Elements/)
- [PieChart](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/PieChart/Overview/)
- [PolarChart](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/PolarChart/Visual_Elements/)
- [RangeSelector](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/RangeSelector/Visual_Elements/)
- [Sankey](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Sankey/Overview/)
- [Sparkline](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Sparkline/Visual_Elements/)
- [TreeMap](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxTreeMap/)
- [VectorMap](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/VectorMap/Visual_Elements/)

Widget customization is described in the [CSS-Based Widgets Customization](/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/CSS-Based_Widgets_Customization/) and [SVG-Based Widgets Customization](/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/SVG-Based_Widgets_Customization/) articles. However, we recommend that you choose a [theme](/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/Predefined_Themes/) to start customization.
