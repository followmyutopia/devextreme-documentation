Since v18.1, the DevExtreme hybrid mobile-related tools, including DevExtreme SPA Framework, are deprecated. See the details in [this blog post](https://community.devexpress.com/blogs/aspnet/archive/2018/02/26/devextreme-hybrid-mobile-tools-deprecation-in-v18-1.aspx). Mobile tools documentation is removed from new versions, but you can still find it [in the older versions](/Documentation/17_2/Guide/SPA_Framework/Application_Development/).
