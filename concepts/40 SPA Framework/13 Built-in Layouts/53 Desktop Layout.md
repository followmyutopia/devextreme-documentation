The Desktop layout is available for the 'generic' platform only. This platform is set when the application is running in a desktop, or the current platform is not known to the framework. You can also set the 'generic' platform [manually](/Documentation/ApiReference/Common/Utils/devices/Methods/#currentdeviceName) to make the application look like a web site.

The Desktop layout is characterized by the presence of a navigation control on a view. The navigation control is a global navigation that provides access to the root views of the application. In addition, there is a toolbar on the view, which you can use to add custom actions.
