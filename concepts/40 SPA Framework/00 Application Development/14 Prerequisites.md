The DevExtreme SPA framework is based on JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3. When developing DevExtreme applications, you will only need to use [JavaScript](http://www.w3schools.com/js/), [HTML](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp) and [CSS](http://www.w3schools.com/css/). In addition, you will need basic knowledge of [Knockout](http://learn.knockoutjs.com/) and [jQuery](http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp).

Optionally, you can use [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) when developing DevExtreme applications. The TypeScript definition files come with the DevExtreme package. Use the [TypeScript-based Application Template](/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Project_Templates/#Basic_Application_Type_Script) to develop DevExtreme applications using TypeScript.

You need to reference [Globalize](https://github.com/jquery/globalize/releases) only if your application should support the following functionality.

1. Non-English locales
2. Custom message dictionaries
3. Non-USD currency [formatting](/Documentation/ApiReference/Common/Object_Structures/format/)
4. Custom date and number [formatting](/Documentation/ApiReference/Common/Object_Structures/format/)

To learn more about how to use the Globalize library refer the [Localization Using Globalize](/Documentation/Guide/Common/Localization/#Using_Localization_Libraries/Using_Globalize) topic.

You can use **any familiar code editor** (e.g., **Sublime Text**) to develop DevExtreme applications, or you can use Visual Studio. In this instance, project templates, a design-time environment, a device simulator and wizards for easy application packaging are all available to you.
