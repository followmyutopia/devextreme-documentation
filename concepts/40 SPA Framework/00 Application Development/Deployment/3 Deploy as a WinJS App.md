To deploy an application built using the DevExtreme SPA framework as a WinJS app, use the [Multi-Channel Application](/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Project_Templates/#Multi-Channel_Application) project template and choose **Win** as a target platform in the DevExtreme Project Wizard. The solution created using this template will include the [Shared](/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Project_Templates/#Multi-Channel_Application/Shared_Project) project for developing a DevExtreme application and the [Win](/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Project_Templates/#Multi-Channel_Application/Win_Project) project for deploying the DevExtreme application as a WinJS app. You can use standard deployment procedures provided for the Win project in Visual Studio. Since the Shared project is [linked](/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Linking_DevExtreme_Projects/) to the Win project, the resulting application will be the DevExtreme application deployed as a WinJS app.

If you do not use the **Multi-Channel Application** application template, but have a [DevExtreme application project](/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Project_Templates/#DevExtreme_App_Project_Template) designed in Visual Studio, you can still deploy it as a WinJS app. For this purpose, add a standard Win project to your solution and link the DevExtreme project to the Win project.
