First, ensure that the DevExtreme SPA framework meets your needs. This framework is developed for building the following types of mobile applications.

- Business applications, including those that support the BYOD concept.
- Mobile applications with a UI native to the target platform (according to the UI guidelines provided for this platform).
- Applications that are developed for functional purposes, rather than purely entertainment purposes.
- Applications that consist of several views with lists and forms.

Here are some examples of such applications:


- Applications for getting services and placing an order  

	- Delivery services (pizza, sushi)
	- Searching for nearby objects on a map (cash machines, bars, etc.)
	- Booking services (accommodations, flight tickets, etc.)

- Social networks  

- Automation of business processes that include data access from mobile devices.

	- Applications for realtors, providing access to the current state of available real estate properties.
	- Applications for taxi companies, to organize routes for available cars.
	- Mobile dashboards, to provide the current state of sales/affairs/bugs.
	- Mobile applications for surveys.

- Mobile applications for data input and analysis

	- A shopping list.
	- Personal finance trackers.
	- To-Do lists.

The following applications should not be built with the DevExtreme SPA Framework.

- Applications with a complex graphic interface.
- Applications dealing with binary data.
