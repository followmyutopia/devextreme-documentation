####Nuget Packages####

When using **Visual Studio** for development, you can easily add the dx.mobile and dx.web libraries to your ASP.NET project (WebForms, MVC) or Windows Store JavaScript application using the dx.mobile and dx.web NuGet packages. To do this, follow the steps below.

1. Right-click your project in the **Solution Explorer** window and choose **Manage NuGet Packages...** in the context menu.

	 Make sure that [nuget.org](http://www.nuget.org) is set as your online source. Then, type *PhoneJS*/*WebAppJS* within the **Search Online** text box. 

3. When the search is complete, click the **Install** button in the search result.

After the **PhoneJS**/**WebAppJS** NuGet package is successfully installed, you will find it in the list of installed packages along with the **Globalize**, **jQuery** and **Knockout** packages on which the PhoneJS and WebAppJS libraries depend.

Once you have installed the NuGet package, you will be able to update the PhoneJS/WebAppJS library to the latest version from the **Updates** section of the **Manage NuGet Packages** window.
 
You can find more information about the PhoneJS and WebAppJS NuGet packages in the NuGet Gallery (see [PhoneJS](http://www.nuget.org/packages/PhoneJS/) and [WebAppJS](http://www.nuget.org/packages/WebAppJS/)).
