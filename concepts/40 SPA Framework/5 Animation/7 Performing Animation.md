In DevExtreme applications, the [TransitionExecutor](/Documentation/ApiReference/Common/Utils/TransitionExecutor/) object is used to perform animation. This object is designed so that it can perform several animations simultaneously or in a staggered manner, applying the animation presets that are registered for the [device](/Documentation/ApiReference/Common/Object_Structures/device/) on which the current application is currently running.
