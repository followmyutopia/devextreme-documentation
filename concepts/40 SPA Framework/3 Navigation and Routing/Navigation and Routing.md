Similarly to regular web applications, a DevExtreme application uses URLs to change the current view. The framework tracks the URL fragment identifier. If the URL changes, the framework initiates a transition to the view whose name is encoded in the URL. In addition, the framework keeps track of all the invoked views and caches the view's rendered markup. As a result, when you go back to a previously visited view, it is displayed immediately without rendering or querying data. 

Since a DevExtreme application has only one web page, the view name along with the associated parameters must be encoded/decoded from the fragment identifier of the application URL. The process of encoding and decoding URLs is called routing. Routing is governed by routing rules, and each application must provide a set of rules. Once you have defined routing rules, you can use URLs containing view names and their parameters to navigate between views in your application.
