[Summary values](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Widgets/Pivot_Grid/Summaries/) are numbers, displayed in grid cells. In OLAP terminology, fields that are put to the data area are called **measures** and a single record (usually representing a business transaction) is called **fact**. Summary (measure) value is calculated by the aggregation of field values from a number of facts [taken from the data source](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/PivotGridDataSource/Configuration/fields/#dataField). The set of facts to be aggregated is different for each pivot grid cell and depends on three dimensional areas (row, column and filter). The aggregation method is configured using the [summaryType](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/PivotGridDataSource/Configuration/fields/#summaryType) option.

There is a number of options related to the display format that can be configured:

* [format](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/PivotGridDataSource/Configuration/fields/#format) &#8212; specifies a display format for field values;
* [customizeText](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/PivotGridDataSource/Configuration/fields/#customizeText) &#8212; allows you to customize the text to be displayed in the cells of a field.
