You can interact with the pivot grid fields using the API methods of pivot grid data source. If you did not create a separate [PivotGridDataSource](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/PivotGridDataSource/) object, use the [getDataSource()](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxPivotGrid/Methods/#getDataSource) method of the **PivotGrid** widget to acquire the pivot grid's current data source. Tasks that can be solved using the API are presented below.
