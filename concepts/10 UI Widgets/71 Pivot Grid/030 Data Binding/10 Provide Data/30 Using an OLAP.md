DevExtreme is supplied with the [XmlaStore](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/XmlaStore/) Store type, which is used to interact with OLAP servers using an XMLA standard. If you intended to use OLAP technology for analyzing your data with the Pivot Grid widget, follow the steps below and you will learn how to configure the Microsoft Analysis Services and connect the **PivotGrid** widget to it. 

[note] If you use another OLAP server that supports an XMLA standard, refer to the documentation for this server and learn how to configure HTTP access to it, then jump to step 6 of the list below.

1.&nbsp;Install Microsoft Analysis Services. For details, refer to the [How to: Install Analysis Services by Using Setup](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms143764(v=sql.100).aspx) MSDN article.
 
2.&nbsp;Install **SQL Server Data Tools â€• Business Intelligence** for your version of Visual Studio ([Visual Studio 2012 version](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36843)).
 
3.&nbsp;Create a new project and define a Cube. For details, refer to the [Multidimensional Modeling](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms170208.aspx) MSDN tutorial. If you would like to use sample data instead of your own, refer to the [Install Sample Data and Projects](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh403424.aspx) MSDN article.
 
4.&nbsp;Configure HTTP access to the Analysis Services. For details, refer to the [Configure HTTP Access to Analysis Services on Internet Information Services (IIS) 8.0](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg492140.aspx) MSDN article.
 
5.&nbsp;Configure IIS to allow cross-domain access to the OLAP application created in step 4.     
     
[note] IIS configuration for cross-domain authenticated access is not considered in this article. For educational purposes, please use the *Anonymous* authentication type or configure the OLAP server at the same domain with the IIS server.

&emsp;5.1.&nbsp;Add the HTTP Response Headers. In the OLAP application, in the **Home** pane, double-click **HTTP Response Headers**. Add the following custom headers.
     
- *Name*: "Access-Control-Allow-Headers", *Value:* "Content-Type"        
- *Name:* "Access-Control-Allow-Methods", *Value:* "POST"        
- *Name:* "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" , *Value:* *&lt;the host from which you are going to access this server or "\*" for all hosts&gt;*

&emsp;5.2.&nbsp;While configuring HTTP access, you added an "OLAP" script map to the OLAP application (Step 3, items 6-8 of the [Configure HTTP Access to Analysis Services on Internet Information Services (IIS) 8.0](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg492140.aspx) MSDN article). To make the cross-domain access work, make sure the "OPTIONSVerbHandler" is at the top of the **Handler Mappings** list. To access the list's order, click **View Ordered List...** from the **Actions** menu. If the "OPTIONSVerbHandler" is not at the top of the list, select the "OPTIONSVerbHandler" and use the **Move Up** command from the Actions menu to move it to the top. Also make sure the **OLAP** handler is located above other *.dll handlers (even the disabled ones). 

6.&nbsp;Configure the **PivotGrid** | **dataSource** | [store](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/PivotGridDataSource/Configuration/store/) object for using your OLAP server. To learn how to display data from an OLAP cube in the pivot grid, refer to the [Use OLAP Data for  PivotGrid](/Documentation/Tutorial/UI_Widgets/Use_OLAP_Data_for_PivotGrid/) tutorial.
