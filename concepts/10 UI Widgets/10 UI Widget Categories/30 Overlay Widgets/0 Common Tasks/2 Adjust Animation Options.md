An overlay widget enables you to adjust animation effects used when the widget is being shown or hidden. The animation options are accessed using the **animation** configuration option. The animation configuration object includes separate properties that hold animation options used when the widget is being shown and hidden. These properties are called **show** and **hide** respectively. Objects passed to these properties have the same structure, which enables you to specify the following main options.

 - Animation type  
 The animation type is specified using the [type](/Documentation/ApiReference/Common/Object_Structures/animationConfig/#type) option. The available types are "fade", "pop" and "slide".

 - Initial and target state  
 The widget state at the beginning of animation is specified using the [from](/Documentation/ApiReference/Common/Object_Structures/animationConfig/#from) option. The [to](/Documentation/ApiReference/Common/Object_Structures/animationConfig/#to) option specifies the target widget state.
