To create mobile applications based on Knockout binding, you will need a framework to manage view navigation and rendering. The [DevExtreme SPA framework](/Documentation/Guide/Common/Introduction_to_DevExtreme/#Mobile_Development/Overview) solves these tasks. So the **Knockout** application template is based on the DevExtreme SPA framework. You can learn template structure details from the **SPA Framework** | [Application Project](/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Application_Project/) article. To learn how to build applications using the SPA framework, refer to the [Application Design](/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Application_Development/) article. To learn how to create DevExtreme widgets using the Knockout approach, refer to the [Widget Basics - Knockout Approach](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Widgets/Basics/Widget_Basics_-_Knockout/#Create_and_Configure_a_Widget) topic.

[note]The **Knockout** application template uses the [NavBar](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxNavBar/) widget as a global navigation control. You can change it to the [SlideOut](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxSlideOut/) widget. To learn how to do this, refer to the [Use a SlideOut Menu](/Documentation/Tutorial/SPA_Framework/Use_a_SlideOut_Menu/#Use_a_SlideOut_Menu) tutorial.
