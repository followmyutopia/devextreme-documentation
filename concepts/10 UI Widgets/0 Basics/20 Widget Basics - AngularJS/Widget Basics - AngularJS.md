From this article, you will learn how to perform basic operations on a DevExtreme widget using the AngularJS framework. Similar articles are available for the [jQuery](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Widgets/Basics/Widget_Basics_-_jQuery/) library and the [Knockout](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Widgets/Basics/Widget_Basics_-_Knockout/) framework.

DevExtreme UI widgets can be used in applications built using the [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) version 1.2 and 1.3. 

[note]If you use AngularJS version 1.3, pay attention to the [Migration Guide](http://ng-learn.org/2014/06/Migration_Guide_from_1-2_to1-3/).

[note]DevExtreme provides a CTP version of the [Angular 2 integration module](https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-angular2). This version is available for your evaluation, yet it has some issues waiting to be addressed. Keep track of them or post a newly-found one on [this GitHub page](https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-angular2/issues).
