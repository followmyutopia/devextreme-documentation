The [Form](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxForm/) widget is intended to visually represent and edit data stored in an object that has a specific structure. The widget enables you to bind each layout item to an appropriate field of an existing data object, as well as to generate a new data object according to current values of the form fields.
