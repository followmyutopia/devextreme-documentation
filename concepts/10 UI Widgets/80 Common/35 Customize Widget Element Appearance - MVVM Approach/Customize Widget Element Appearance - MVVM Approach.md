You may often encounter the need to customize widget appearance. In the most simple cases, widget elements (title, content, collection item) have a simple textual presentation. But in most cases, widget elements require a more complex structure. Moreover, an element appearance may depend on values held in a data model associated with the current view. In this topic, you will learn how to customize the appearance of such widget elements.

If a widget contains elements available for customization, it includes the corresponding options that end with "Template". For instance, the [Popover](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxPopover/) widget enables you to customize its content and title. For this purpose, it includes the [contentTemplate](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxPopover/Configuration/#contentTemplate) and [titleTemplate](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxPopover/Configuration/#titleTemplate) options.
