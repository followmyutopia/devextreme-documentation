A normal appointment is a non-recurring appointment that has start and end dates specified. Here is an example of objects defining a normal appointment.

	<!--JavaScript-->var appointments = [
		{text: 'Meet with a customer', startDate: new Date(2015, 4, 10, 11, 0), endDate: new Date(2015, 4, 10, 13, 0)},
		{text: 'Discuss results', startDate: new Date(2015, 5, 11, 12, 0), endDate: new Date(2015, 4, 11, 13, 0)}
	]
