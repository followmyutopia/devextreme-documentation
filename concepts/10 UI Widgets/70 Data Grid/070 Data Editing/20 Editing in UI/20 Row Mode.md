In the row mode, all changes made in grid rows are reflected in the data source immediately after the row switches from the editing state back to the normal state.

* **Editing**		
Each row in the row mode is supplied with the *"Edit"* button. When a user clicks this button, the respective row enters the editing state. At the same time, the *"Save"* and *"Cancel"* buttons appear in place of the *"Edit"* button. A user must click the *"Save"* button to save changes or the *"Cancel"* button to discard them.

	[note] When a grid row is in the editing state, and a user clicks the *"Edit"* button of another row, the former one switches its state to normal. All changes made in this row (if any) vanish.

* **Insertion**		
To insert a new row, a user must click the *"Add"* button indicated by a cross glyph on a grid.

* **Removing**		
To remove a row, a user must click the *"Delete"* button accompanying this row. This will cause **DataGrid** to display a pop-up window requesting the user to confirm the deletion of the row.
