The advanced remote operations, which are disabled by default, are **grouping** and **summary calculation**. To enable advanced remote operations along with [basic remote operations](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Widgets/Data_Grid/Use_Custom_Store/#Remote_Operations/Basic_Remote_Operations), set the [remoteOperations](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/remoteOperations/) option to *true*.
