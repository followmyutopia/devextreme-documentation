Another important property of a grid column is its index. It can be used for obtaining or changing column options by calling the [columnOption](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Methods/#columnOptioncolumnIndex), or for implementing callback functions, such as the [editCellTemplate](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/columns/#editCellTemplate) or [onCellClick](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#onCellClick). Note that those indexes differ. The index passed to the **columnOption** method - an "initial" index - equals the index of the column in the [columns](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/columns/) array. The index used in callback functions is equal to the ["visible" index](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/columns/#visibleIndex) of the column. It depends on the current location of a column in the grid and changes dynamically when a user reorders columns or performs grouping. The following image illustrates how the "visible" index is calculated.

The "initial" index of a column can be obtained within a callback function also. For this purpose, use the **column.index** property of the object passed to this function as the argument.
