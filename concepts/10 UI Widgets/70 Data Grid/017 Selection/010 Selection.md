Selection is a **DataGrid** feature that allows an end-user to mark certain rows in a grid as selected. Selected rows have a differing appearance from regular rows. After a row is selected, its data may be processed the way you require.

[note] Only [data rows](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Widgets/Data_Grid/Visual_Elements/#Grid_Rows) can be selected.

In the following subtopics, you will learn how to configure selection in a UI and in code, select rows initially and use the keyboard to perform selection.
