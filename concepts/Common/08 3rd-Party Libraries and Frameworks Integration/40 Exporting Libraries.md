The DevExtreme [DataGrid](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/) widget supports client-side data export - see [Client-Side Export](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Client-Side_Export/). To accomplish this, a reference to the JSZip library is required. This library can be found in the DevExtreme zip archive or in the folder where you have installed DevExtreme, which is **C:\Program Files (x86)\DevExpress 17.1\DevExtreme\Sources** by default.
