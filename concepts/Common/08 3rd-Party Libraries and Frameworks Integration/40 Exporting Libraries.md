The DevExtreme [DataGrid](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/) widget supports client-side data export - see [Client-Side Export](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Widgets/Data_Grid/Client-Side_Export/). To accomplish this, a reference to the *jsZip.js* JavaScript library is required. This library is accessible within your [DevExtreme Package](/Documentation/Guide/Common/DevExtreme_Packages/#DevExtreme_Packages).
