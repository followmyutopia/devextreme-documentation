The [DevExtreme data layer](/Documentation/Guide/Data_Layer/Data_Layer/) includes the Store data access interface, which is supported by all DevExtreme UI widgets working with data, such as the **List**, **Gallery**, **DataGrid** widgets, etc. DevExtreme includes several Store implementations out-of-the-box. To consume OData web services, use the ready-to-use [ODataStore](/Documentation/Guide/Data_Layer/Data_Source_Examples/#OData).

In addition to the ODataStore, we introduced the [BreezeJS](https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme-14.2-DataLayerExtensions/tree/master/breeze) and [JayData](https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme-14.2-DataLayerExtensions/tree/master/jayData) extensions, which contain classes accessing data using the [BreezeJS](http://www.getbreezenow.com/) and [JayData](http://jaydata.org/) libraries respectively.
