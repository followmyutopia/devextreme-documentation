DevExtreme comes with a set of widgets for visualizing data: charts, gauges, sparklines, vector map, etc. Whether you combine these widgets to beautiful informative dashboards or use them individually, it is easy to configure them to solve any visualization puzzle.

All the DevExtreme data visualization widgets are initially designed to look in a single style. For this purpose, DevExtreme provides 'desktop', 'ios', 'android' and 'win10' themes. You can set the required one or define a custom one and apply it.

	A big number of series types is provided, so you can choose the ones that are better appropriate for the current task. In addition, you can locate different series on different panes one after another, as well as use several value axes to present different data on one chart. To make multi-series charts look attractive and informative, several predefined palettes are supplied. You can choose the one you like most or define a custom one and apply it.

	All the charts are highly interactive, which includes the capability to handle series and point clicks, hovering and selection.

Three types of gauges are currently supplied: circular, linear and a bar gauge. The first two gauge types are more appropriate for displaying the current value of some changing parameter and marking several points on a gauge scale. The bar gauge is appropriate for displaying the current values of several changing parameters at once so that it is easy to compare them at a single glance.
