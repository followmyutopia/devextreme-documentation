A DevExtreme application is implemented using only HTML, JavaScript and CSS are run by a browser. Thus, the documentation for the DevExtreme products is presented independently from a code editor. At the same time, DevExtreme supports MS Visual Studio by providing integrated project templates and designers. These VS-integrated tools are described separately in the <b>Guides</b> | [VS Integration](/Documentation/Guide/#vsintegration) section of the documentation.
