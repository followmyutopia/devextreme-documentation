All the products that DevExtreme provides for mobile development come with the [DevExtreme Mobile](/Documentation/Guide/Common/DevExtreme_Packages/#DevExtreme_Mobile) and [DevExtreme Complete](/Documentation/Guide/Common/DevExtreme_Packages/#DevExtreme_Complete) packages. The **DevExtreme Complete** package has the same libraries as the **DevExtreme Mobile** package, but the former is enlarged by integration in MS Visual Studio: built-in project templates, view designer, device simulator and a wizard for building native packages. If Visual Studio is not the environment that you are used to, the **DevExtreme Mobile** package will be enough, because DevExtreme applications, being HTML/JS applications, can be implemented using a predefined application template in any code editor. In addition, you can use any web server (Apache HTTP Server, IIS or any other) and any device simulation tool ([Ripple](http://ripple.incubator.apache.org/) or another), and pack your application using the [PhoneGap Build](https://build.phonegap.com/).
