DevExtreme widgets can easily be used in an application based on the [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) framework.

To learn how to work with DevExtreme widgets, start from to the [Add a Widget to a Page](/Documentation/Tutorial/UI_Widgets/Add_a_Widget_to_a_Page/#Configure_Widget_-_Angular_Approach) tutorial. This tutorial demonstrates how to add and configure a button - a simple example of a widget.

To help you start quickly with an Angular-based application utilizing DevExtreme widgets, DevExtreme supplies the following [AngularJS application templates](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Widgets/Basics/Application_Templates/#Mobile_Application/Angular_Approach).

- **Navbar**  
A mobile application template where the [NavBar](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxNavBar/) widget is used for global navigation on iOS and Android devices and the [Pivot](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxPivot/) widget - on Windows Phone 8 devices.

- **SlideOut**  
A mobile application template where the [SlideOut](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxSlideOut/) widget is used for global navigation.

To build applications using these templates, start with the following tutorials.

- <b>Code editor-independent start</b>  
	Start from the [Use Widgets in an AngularJS Mobile App](/Documentation/Tutorial/UI_Widgets/Use_Widgets_in_an_AngularJS_Mobile_App/) tutorial. It is presented in a special 'playground' where you can read the description of each step, find the code implemented at each step and see the running application in a device simulator. You can also edit code at any step. The project and tutorial contents are also available. As a result, you will implement a simple application and will learn the basics of working with DevExtreme widgets in AngularJS applications.

- <b>Visual Studio-specific start</b>  
	Start from the [Create AngularJS Mobile App in Visual Studio](/Documentation/Tutorial/VS_Integration/Create_AngularJS_Mobile_App_in_Visual_Studio/) tutorial. This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a DevExtreme application based on the AngularJS framework in Visual Studio. You will be introduced to the *NavBar AngularJS project template*, a view designer and device simulator - the VS-integrated tools that simplify the process of implementing mobile applications in VS. As a result, you will implement a simple application and will learn the basics of working with DevExtreme widgets in AngularJS applications.
