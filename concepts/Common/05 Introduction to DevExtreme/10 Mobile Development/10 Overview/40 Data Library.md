DevExtreme UI widgets work with a specially designed DataSource object from the **DevExtreme Data library**. The DataSource is intended to simplify working with data, whether it be an in-memory array, a local browser storage, remote service, or any custom storage. The DataSource is a stateful object that keeps sorting, grouping, filtering, and keeps data transformation options and applies them each time data is loaded. It also provides events intended to handle changing data and the state. The DataSource underlying data access logic is isolated in a Store. Unlike the DataSource, a Store is a stateless object implementing a universal interface for reading and modifying data from a particular data storage. Regardless of the data storage type, a Store exposes the same set of methods.
