DevExtreme Mobile contains everything you'll need to create native client applications using HTML5 & JavaScript and to deliver solutions with a single codebase that targets today's most popular smartphones and tablet devices.

DevExtreme Mobile is distributed as a ZIP file. Unzip the downloaded archive to a directory where you wish to store the files. Note that this is not a temporary folder - no further installation or unpacking is required. However, if you need to change these files to a different directory, simply move them to the new location.

The DevExtreme Mobile folder contains the following subfolders.
