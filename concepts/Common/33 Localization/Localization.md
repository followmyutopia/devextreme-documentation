Localization adapts your application to linguistic and regional differences. DevExtreme allows you to localize:

- Messages (using [dictionaries](/Documentation/Guide/Common/Localization/#Dictionaries))
- Numbers, dates, and currencies (using [Intl](/Documentation/Guide/Common/Localization/#Localize_Dates_Numbers_and_Currencies/Using_Intl) or [Globalize](/Documentation/Guide/Common/Localization/#Localize_Dates_Numbers_and_Currencies/Using_Globalize)).

DevExtreme also supports [right-to-left layout](/Documentation/Guide/Common/Localization/#Right-to-Left_Support).

[note] Refer to the [Using Intl](/Documentation/Guide/ASP.NET_MVC_Controls/Localization/Using_Intl/) and [Using Globalize](/Documentation/Guide/ASP.NET_MVC_Controls/Localization/Using_Globalize/) articles if you are localizing DevExtreme ASP.NET MVC Control.
