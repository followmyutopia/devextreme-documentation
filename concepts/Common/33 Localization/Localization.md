Localization adapts your application to linguistic and regional differences. DevExtreme widgets allow you to localize:

- Messages (using [dictionaries](/Documentation/Guide/Common/Localization/#Dictionaries))
- Numbers, dates, and currencies (using a [localization library](/Documentation/Guide/Common/Localization/#Using_Localization_Libraries): Intl or Globalize).

Additional functionality includes [value formatting](/Documentation/Guide/Common/Localization/#Value_Formatting) and [right-to-left layout](/Documentation/Guide/Common/Localization/#Right-to-Left_Support) support.

[note] If you are localizing DevExtreme ASP.NET MVC Controls, see the [Using Intl](/Documentation/Guide/ASP.NET_MVC_Controls/Localization/Using_Intl/) and [Using Globalize](/Documentation/Guide/ASP.NET_MVC_Controls/Localization/Using_Globalize/) articles.
