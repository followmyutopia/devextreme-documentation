DevExtreme provides an [API](/Documentation/ApiReference/Common/utils/localization/) for localizing messages, dates, and numbers in your app. 

To localize a message, add it to a dictionary as shown in the [Add Strings to a Dictionary](/Documentation/Guide/Common/Localization/#Dictionaries/Add_Strings_to_a_Dictionary) article.

To localize a custom date or number, apply a format to it as shown in the [Format Custom Values](/Documentation/Guide/Common/Value_Formatting/#Format_Custom_Values) article.
