Replace older DevExtreme files with the latest version. You can find the new files in the DevExtreme zip archive or DevExtreme folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\DevExpress 18.1\DevExtreme\Sources\Lib by default).

You should make the same changes to the new CSS files instead of replacing them if you customized the old CSS files.
