Since v19.1, the DevExtreme hybrid mobile-related tools, including DevExtreme SPA Framework, are excluded from the shipment package. Do not upgrade applications that use them.

If an application that uses the mobile tools is still in active development, we suggest migrating it to an alternative framework described in <a href="https://community.devexpress.com/blogs/aspnet/archive/2018/02/26/devextreme-hybrid-mobile-tools-deprecation-in-v18-1.aspx" target="_blank">this blog post</a>.
