Follow the steps below to manually upgrade your applications that use DevExtreme libraries.

- **Update Scripts**  
Copy the new JavaScript files from the **[Sources]**/**Lib**/**js** DevExtreme folder to the equivalent folder in your applications.

- **Update Stylesheets**  
    Copy the new CSS files from the **[Sources]**/**Lib**/**css** DevExtreme folder to the equivalent folder in your applications.

    [note]The **css** folder must include the **icons** folder with font icons.

- **Update Layouts**  
Copy the new [layout](/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Built-in_Layouts/) files from the **[Sources]**/**Lib**/**layouts** DevExtreme folder to the equivalent folder in your applications.

You can find all these resources within your [DevExtreme package](/Documentation/Guide/Common/DevExtreme_Packages/).

[note]If you customized layouts or stylesheets in your apps, do not replace them, but rather merge them with the ones supplied by the new DevExtreme version.
