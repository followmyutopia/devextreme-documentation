We always do our best to minimize the impact each new version may have on your projects. Occasionally, however, it is necessary to change the behavior of our tools and/or make certain members deprecated. We do this to improve the quality of our products. Take a look at the deprecated API and the list of breaking changes that accompany each release.

- **Deprecated API**  
Run an application updated to the newest DevExtreme version. The browser console will contain information about the deprecated API used in this application and the new members to be used instead. Although the application keeps working with the deprecated API, we still recommend that you use the new API in it. In DevExtreme, deprecated API will remain functional for two more versions of our tools, at which time it will be removed with an announcement about the possible occurrence of breaking changes.

- **Breaking Changes**  
Take into account the [breaking changes](https://www.devexpress.com/Support/WhatsNew/DevExtreme) in each release and upgrade your apps according to the instructions given for each breaking change.
