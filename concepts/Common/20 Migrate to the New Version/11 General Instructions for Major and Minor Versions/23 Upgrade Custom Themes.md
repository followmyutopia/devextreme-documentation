If you built your custom themes based on the [DevExtreme predefined themes](/Documentation/Guide/Themes/Predefined_Themes/) in a [Theme Builder](/Documentation/Guide/Themes/Theme_Builder/), update them each time a new product version (a minor or a major one) is released. This is needed to apply the changes that may possibly be performed in the predefined themes that you used as a base. 

When you built your custom theme in a Theme Builder, you saved the differences from the base theme by using the **Export** feature to a file (there are instructions in the [Save the Changes](/Documentation/Guide/Themes/Theme_Builder/#Save_the_Changes) topic). Follow the steps below to apply these differences to the corresponding newly released base theme.

- Open the [Theme Builder](/ThemeBuilder/).

- Press **Import**. Paste the differences that you saved in the JSON format (using the **Export** feature) to the invoked window. Click **Apply**.

- Check that all your differences are applied and perform customizations if required.
