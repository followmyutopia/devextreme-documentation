The following changes consider applications built with [PhoneGap](https://build.phonegap.com/).

- The `devextremeaddon` plugin, which was required by WinPhone 8 apps only, has been marked obsolete. Remove the link to it from the "config.xml" file.

- The public repository with plugins on the PhoneGap Build has been removed in favor of npm packages and git repositories. Read the announcement in this [blogpost](http://phonegap.com/blog/2016/10/13/pgb-repository-shutting-down/).
