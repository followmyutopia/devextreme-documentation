Follow the steps below to upgrade a theme created in the ThemeBuilder if you [saved the theme's metadata](/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/ThemeBuilder/#Postpone_Customization):

1. Open the ThemeBuilder at the [Import a Theme from DevExtreme Metadata](https://devexpress.github.io/ThemeBuilder/import/meta) view.

1. On the view, click **Upload File** and select the `.json` file that you exported previously. If you copied the metadata rather than exported it as a `.json` file, paste it in the text area and click **Upload Metadata**:

1. Check that the metadata is applied, perform additional customizations if required, and [export the upgraded theme](/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/ThemeBuilder/#Export_the_Resulting_Theme).
