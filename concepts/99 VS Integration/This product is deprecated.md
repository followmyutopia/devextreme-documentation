From v18.1, the DevExtreme hybrid mobile-related tools, including mobile tools for Visual Studio, are deprecated. See <a href="https://community.devexpress.com/blogs/aspnet/archive/2018/02/26/devextreme-hybrid-mobile-tools-deprecation-in-v18-1.aspx" target="_blank">this blog post</a> for more information. The mobile tools documentation was removed from the newer versions, but you can still find it [in the older versions](/Documentation/17_2/Guide/VS_Integration/Project_Templates/).

[Visual Studio tools for DevExtreme ASP.NET MVC Controls](/Documentation/Guide/ASP.NET_MVC_Controls/Visual_Studio_Integration/Project_Templates/) remain in active development.
