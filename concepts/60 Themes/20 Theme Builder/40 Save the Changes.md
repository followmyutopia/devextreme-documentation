You may need to save the changes that you made to receive a custom theme in the following cases.

- If you have not finished your custom theme but need to close the Theme Builder, you can save the changes you made during the current session.
- When a new product version is released (a minor or major one), the stylesheets of the predefined themes may be changed. To apply these changes, it is recommended that you save your custom theme in a form of differences from the predefined theme. When you upgrade to the new product version, you should apply your differences to the newly released version of the corresponding theme.

To save the changes (differences), use the **Export** button on the top menu of the site.

In the invoked window, you will see your changes displayed in the JSON format.

Copy these changes to the buffer and then save them to the required file on your machine.

To continue working with the previously saved changes or apply them to the newly released version of the corresponding theme, use the **Import** button. Paste the changes that you saved in the JSON format (using the Export window) to the invoked window.
