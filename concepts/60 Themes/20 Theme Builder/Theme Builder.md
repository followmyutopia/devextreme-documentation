The **Theme Builder** is a tool for creating custom themes based on predefined DevExtreme and Bootstrap themes. You can use it as follows:

- Access the [online version](/ThemeBuilder/) or click **Run Theme Builder** in a [DevExtreme project's](/Documentation/Guide/VS_Integration/Project_Templates/) context menu in Visual Studio.

- Run the local version by opening the index.html file located in the C:\Program Files (x86)\DevExpress 17.2\DevExtreme\Tools\DevExtreme\ThemeBuilder directory by default. This version is available only if you have istalled DevExtreme using the [installer for Windows](/Documentation/Guide/Common/Introduction_to_DevExtreme/#Download_and_Install).

The **Theme Builder** divides theming settings into two groups: **Basic Theming** for the most frequently used settings, and **Advanced Theming** for more advanced and widget-specific settings.
